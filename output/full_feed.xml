     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-to-honor-native-american-culture-with-dance-art-food</link>
     <description>Powwow dances, storytelling, native foods set for Tiburon’s first Native American heritage celebration Aug. 17 at Zelinsky Park.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arts and crafts, storytelling and a live dance performance from an internationally touring group are planned for Tiburon’s inaugural celebration of Native American culture and heritage, set for 1-4 p.m. Aug. 17 at Zelinsky Park.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to work with members of the American Indian community in Tiburon and Marin County to highlight the richness of contemporary Native American culture here in town,” said Heritage and Arts Commission Chair Arjun Gupta. The commission is co-organizing the free event, which also received financial support from Tiburon’s Diversity Inclusion Task Force.</p>
<p>A highlight of the afternoon will be “powwow-style dances” performed by Sewam American Indian Dance. Tiburon resident and event co-organizer Eddie Madril, who co-directs the troupe with his wife, Sara Moncada, said the group will also educate attendees on origins of the dances performed and of regalia worn, and their performances will include audience participation for all ages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon officials back flood study for Greenwood Cove Drive</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-officials-back-flood-study-for-greenwood-cove-drive</link>
     <description>$200k proposal aims to ease chronic road problems tied to tides and runoff</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon officials have backed spending an initial $200,000 to find easy fixes for frequent flooding along a stretch of Greenwood Cove Drive that sometimes spills over onto Tiburon Boulevard.</p>
<p>The Marin Flood Control Zone 4 advisory board voted 3-0 at its July 22 meeting to direct county staff to send out requests for proposals to evaluate the area’s tidal flooding and stormwater drainage, particularly drainage from Upper Cecilia Way into East Creek. Member Liza Gregory Bass was absent, and the advisory board has one vacancy.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a very worthwhile investment,” said member Sheldon Dorph, who sits on a subcommittee that determined the scope of the study. He said the study would eventually help “so that I don’t need a boat to get out of my house, but I can still take the car.”</p>
<p>The Greenwood Cove Drive-Tiburon Boulevard corridor, which has segments in both incorporated and unincorporated Tiburon, has been known to flood following seasonal king tides. The flooding is magnified during substantial rainfall, sometimes causing the water to make its way to inbound Tiburon Boulevard, as it did last December, causing ankle-high flooding on Greenwood Cove and submerging an inbound lane on the boulevard next to the 76 gas station and the Marin Transit bus stop.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Mallard Pointe faces delays as city flags incomplete permits, tenant-benefit issues</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/mallard-pointe-faces-delays-as-city-flags-incomplete-permits-tenant-benefit-issues</link>
     <description>Revisions were expected as routine back-and-forth process enters next phase</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Mallard Pointe housing development faces construction delays until at least next spring after Belvedere officials found the developer failed to provide relocation benefits to displaced tenants and submitted incomplete permit applications missing dozens of required approvals.</p>
<p>The 40-unit lagoon-front project across from City Hall would demolish 22 existing rental units and build 40 new units at 1-22 Mallard Road. Belvedere on July 22 sent Thompson Dorfman LLC, a partner in owner Mallard Pointe 1951 LLC, incompleteness notices regarding the initial demolition and infrastructure plans submitted between October and April and bulkhead-replacement plans submitted in January and February, along with a compliance inquiry letter submitted June 18.</p>
<p>Principal Bruce Dorfman said he plans to submit revisions in the coming weeks and hopes to begin work next spring. He and Planning Director Rebecca Markwick both noted the process is routine, with Dorfman saying this kicks off what likely will be several iterations back and forth in a process that could last through the end of the year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Garden Plot: Hydrangeas sport plentiful summer blooms</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/garden-plot-hydrangeas-sport-plentiful-summer-blooms</link>
     <description>Hydrangeas thrive in summer — columnist Diane Lynch shares growing tips, drying advice and favorite cultivars for local gardens.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hydrangeas are one of the most luscious flowering plants you can grow. They set blooms in late spring, and summer is their heyday. As the blooms open, there will be a huge mound of bright green foliage dotted with gigantic flowers. At peak bloom, a single flower can make a bouquet by itself.</p>
<p>Hydrangeas like shade as a rule, but in our cool climate can tolerate a little sun, though midday sun can scorch the leaves. I was talking to a rose grower in Sonoma who also grew hydrangeas for sale. He told me that hydrangeas like shade but also want to see the sky. I have one in my lower garden that’s under a plum tree, and it blooms very late because it cannot see the sky.</p>
<p>If you want to dry them for extended enjoyment, now through late summer is the time to do so. You want to dry them when in full bloom and not yet faded. You can hang them upside down in a closet or shady place outdoors to dry. Or simply letting the water evaporate from a vase will often result in a nicely dried specimen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Paradise Cay’s Kim Gormley wins Marin Fair scone crown with lemon zest recipe; her vegan zucchini bread takes second in breads.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paradise Cay resident Kim Gormley says she’s drawn to baking because it feels more joyful than cooking.</p>
<p>“Cooking, often, is just the daily meal, and for me, it gets a little routine,” she says. “But baking is sort of a special treat a lot of the times, and I like that part about it.”</p>
<p>For Gormley, baking is often celebratory — and her baked goods are also to be celebrated, according to a panel of judges at this year’s Marin County Fair. Gormley’s lemon scones earned first place among all scones at the fair, held July 2-6, while her vegan zucchini bread won second place among all breads.</p>
<p>This year’s wins come after Gormley earned a third-place finish in 2019 for a blueberry cobbler.</p>
<p>“I know it’s very competitive at that exhibit,” Gormley, 59, says. “And to see that the judges felt that my entry was up there with the other entrants, it really made me happy and proud.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Transportation study flags Tiburon, Belvedere among 19 areas at risk from sea rise</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/transportation-study-flags-tiburon-belvedere-among-19-areas-at-risk-from-sea-rise</link>
     <description>Sea-level rise study highlights Tiburon, Belvedere risks; town to vote on funding to launch adaptation plan under SB 272</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will take its first steps toward meeting state mandates to address sea-level rise following a study that identified both Belvedere and Tiburon among 19 vulnerable areas across Marin County.</p>
<p>Grace Ledwith, Tiburon’s climate action and sustainability coordinator, and Councilmember Alice Fredericks said the Town Council will vote tonight, Aug. 6, to accept a $593,877 grant from the California Ocean Protection Council. The grant will help the town meet mandates set by Senate Bill 272, which requires all coastal jurisdictions to develop and adopt Subregional Shoreline Adaptation Plans by 2034.</p>
<p>Tiburon’s planned vote follows the Transportation Authority of Marin board’s 12-0 decision June 26 to accept its sea-level rise study, which aims to address “critical challenges posed by rising sea levels and coastal flooding to Marin County’s transportation infrastructure.” Fredericks and Belvedere Councilmember Pat Carapiet both sit on the transportation authority board.</p>
<p>The study includes a voluntary adaptation policy that could provide additional funding to Tiburon and Belvedere. Jurisdictions that adopt the policy and align their sea-level rise goals with the transportation authority’s plan would gain access to Measure AA sales-tax funds for adaptation support, along with project development assistance, grant writing support and technical assistance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Russia quake triggered 19-hour tsunami advisory; local surge fizzled</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/russia-quake-triggered-19-hour-tsunami-advisory-local-surge-fizzled</link>
     <description>Tiburon Peninsula officials rely on AlertMarin, but just 34% in 94920 are signed up</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Peninsula was under a tsunami alert for nearly 19 hours last week after an 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia’s coast triggered the strongest global tsunami-alert system activation in more than a decade.</p>
<p>No local evacuations were ordered, and no injuries or damage was reported.</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, first issued a tsunami watch July 29, the lowest-level alert, for the U.S. West Coast shortly after the quake struck at 4:25 p.m. Pacific. That was upgraded to an advisory at 6:30 p.m., with the initial surge predicted to hit San Francisco at 12:40 a.m. July 30.</p>
<p>“Stay away from the water! Stay away from beaches and waterways! Remain away from shore until local officials say that it is OK to return,” the National Weather Service Bay Area warned on social media.</p>
<p>Those warnings are standard under a second-tier tsunami advisory, which is issued when the surge is expected to produce strong currents and waves capable of flooding beaches and harbor areas but without widespread coastal inundation. A tsunami warning — like the one briefly issued on the Tiburon Peninsula after December’s 7.0-magnitude quake off Humboldt County — is more severe, signaling a dangerous surge likely to cause major flooding and prompting evacuation of at-risk zones.</p>
<p>By Ark estimates, roughly 1,000 homes, businesses and public facilities sit in Tiburon’s and Belvedere’s combined tsunami inundation zones as mapped by the California Geological Survey, though that’s for an extreme event — a 9.3 Alaskan quake that would send a 13-foot wall of water to the peninsula.</p>
<p>When the tsunami arrived in San Francisco Bay at 1:12 a.m. July 30, initial surges were less than one foot atop normal tides and storm surges. Within hours, the bay experienced tidal swings of 2 to 5 feet within 15-minute periods, creating dangerous currents, according to the weather service.</p>
<p>While tsunami wave heights may seem modest, they travel at jet-plane speeds across deep ocean waters before slowing to 20-30 mph near shore, creating rapidly rising surges that appear as fast-moving floods rather than breaking waves.</p>
<p>Point Reyes recorded the highest tidal deviation in Marin, nearly 2 feet at 4 a.m., more than three hours after the initial surge arrived, the weather service reported. The regional alert was canceled about 11 a.m. July 30, though water levels continued to fluctuate...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>Last week’s 8.8 earthquake in Russia initially triggered a tsunami watch on the West Coast, indicating a tsunami was possible and to be prepared. That was later elevated to a tsunami advisory, which means a tsunami is expected to strike and could cause dangerous currents and waves, potentially flooding beaches and harbors. People are advised to keep their distance. (via NOAA)</media:description>

     <title>Tiburon panel wants community feedback for positive-message street-sign art</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-panel-wants-community-feedback-for-positive-message-street-sign-art</link>
     <description>Tiburon considers street-sign art with positive messages, but pushback prompts officials to seek more feedback and artist revisions.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon arts officials want more community feedback on a proposed public-art project — and more details from the artist — after his positive-message street-sign concept drew less-than-positive responses on social media.</p>
<p>The Heritage and Arts Commission voted 6-0 July 22, with member Azita de Mujica absent, to request a refined proposal from Los Angeles artist Scott Froschauer for “The Word on the Street.” The commission also will seek input from the Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission, homeowners associations, the Public Works Department and other stakeholders once the detailed proposal is ready.</p>
<p>The commission urged community members to attend its next meeting Aug. 26 to discuss the project. No approval has been granted, as the project would need approval from the parks commission and Town Council.</p>
<p>“It’s important that we share with the community the concepts — different kinds of public art,” Commissioner Victoria Fong said. “And it’s OK if they don’t like it — it gets them talking, it’s communication, which is the purpose.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Be Ready Belvedere will host its first major emergency-preparedness event in October, teaching residents how to build go-bags as part of the city’s efforts to improve disaster readiness.</p>
<p>In her July 14 report to the City Council, working-group chair and Councilmember Pat Carapiet provided a five-point disaster-preparedness checklist for residents and announced the “Build a Go Bag” event, set for 5-6 p.m. Oct. 10 at Community Park ahead of the Belvedere Home-Made Film Festival, which starts at 6:30.</p>
<p>The Be Ready Belvedere group originated from a mission last fall to revise the city’s formal emergency operations plan, but it shifted focus to community education when members identified a need for clearer public guidance.</p>
<p>“One of the most frequent questions we have from the community is, ‘What do I do in event of an emergency?’” Carapiet said at the meeting. “There is a feeling that they don’t know what to do, that: ‘Is there plan? What do I do?’”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A former tennis player finds new passion for pickleball</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-former-tennis-player-finds-new-passion-for-pickleball</link>
     <description>At 83, Tiburon resident Robert Moore stays active playing pickleball, adapting to new challenges after rotator-cuff surgery.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Moore visits the Lagoon Road tennis courts twice a week to practice his pickleball serve and exercise.</p>
<p>The 83-year-old Tiburon resident, a longtime former recreational tennis player, took up pickleball several years ago for a second chance on the courts after rotator-cuff surgery limited his ability to make overhand shots.</p>
<p>“Very rarely does the ball come up high as opposed to tennis,” Moore says during a July 23 practice session. The plastic ball used for pickleball has less of a bounce than a tennis ball, he says.</p>
<p>Moore moved to Tiburon in 2010 after spending most of his life in southern New Jersey, where he worked 35 years as a social studies teacher. He and his wife came to California because they were tired of flying west four or five times a year to visit their two children.</p>
<p>While he misses the South Jersey coast — “you can always go on the water from about June to October” — Moore says Tiburon has the weather advantage the rest of the year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>June 30, 1933 – July 7, 2025   Golda Clarkin Boeck, beloved mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, aunt, and community pillar, passed...</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>June 30, 1933 – July 7, 2025</p>
<p>Golda Clarkin Boeck, beloved mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, aunt, and community pillar, passed away peacefully at the age of 92 on July 7, 2025. Born June 30, 1933, to Joseph and Golda Clarkin in Denver, Colorado, Golda was a gifted pianist from an early age, and began performing by 12. She studied Finance with a minor in Music and Literature at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and graduated on the Dean’s List. After college, she worked in Chicago, eventually settling in the Bay Area with her husband, Lawrence Boeck.</p>
<p>For over five decades, Golda made her home in Belvedere, where she raised her family and became a treasured presence in the community. Her life was defined by her devotion to music, her passion for service, and her deep commitment to family. Golda took pride in her work as a real estate broker for over 45 years. She was involved in many civic and musical endeavors — directing and accompanying local theater productions, serving on music committees and fundraising boards, and welcoming new neighbors with her signature hospitality and homemade gifts.</p>
<p>She was Iconic — always elegant and engaged with friends as well as the mah jong, bridge and book club groups whose ages spanned generations. Golda infused holidays and occasions with care and attention, creating meals and moments that brought people together with warmth and style.</p>
<p>She passed on her deep love of the outdoors, her remarkable work ethic, and a strong sense of independence to her children. She encouraged an active life filled with purpose, adventure, and time in nature, including skiing, tennis, swimming, boating, and simply being outdoors.</p>
<p>Golda is predeceased by her step-siblings Joe and Mary, and her younger brother Paul. She is survived by her son, Larry Boeck (Susanna), and grandsons Daniel (Ariella), Eli, and Thomas (and partner Haley); her daughter, Cynthia Boeck Hardy (John), and granddaughters Carina (and partner Tavish) and Chiara; two great-grandchildren, Ellery and Alder Boeck; and beloved nieces, nephews, and their families.</p>
<p>The family is ever thankful to her dedicated caretakers, Gina, and recently, JayVee, and to the numerous friends who brought her much joy. She is certainly writing you all thank you notes as you read this! She will be remembered for her wisdom, humor, generosity, and as a woman of extraordinary capability — someone who made those around her feel seen, valued, and de...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tsunami alert upgraded to advisory for Tiburon Peninsula after Russia earthquake</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tsunami-alert-upgraded-to-advisory-for-tiburon-peninsula-after-russia-earthquake</link>
     <description>Tsunami advisory in effect for Tiburon Peninsula after 8.7 quake off Russia. Residents urged to avoid beaches and waterways.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Note: The MarinOffice of Emergency Managementissued a notice at 10:55 a.m. July 30 that the warning has been canceled.</p>
<p>The Tiburon Peninsula is under a tsunami advisory following an 8.7-magnitude earthquake that struck near Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula at 4:25 today, July 29.</p>
<p>A tsunami watch initially issued for the West Coast wasupgraded to an advisoryabout 6:30 p.m. for California, with the National Weather Service warning residents to stay away from beaches and waterways until further notice. The advisory is the middle level of the warning center’s three-tier alert system: watch, advisory and warning.</p>
<p>Should a tsunami materialize, it would hit San Francisco overnight, at 12:40 a.m. July 30. In the Bay Area, the weather service is forecasting peak tsunami wave heights at less than 1 foot and can arrive as a series of waves or surges over several hours. No evacuations are advised at this time.</p>
<p>“Stay away from the water! Stay away from beaches and waterways! Remain away from shore until local officials say that it is OK to return,” theNational Weather Service Bay Areawarned on social media.</p>
<p>“If you are located in this coastal area, move off the beach and out of harbors and marinas,” the weather service said in the advisory. “Do not go to the coast to watch the tsunami. Be alert to instructions from your local emergency officials.”</p>
<p>The advisory means dangerous currents and waves are possible but does not indicate the widespread destruction associated with a tsunami warning, the highest alert level.</p>
<p>Marin County residents should register for Alert Marin, the county’s emergency notification system that delivers critical information during disasters, viaalertmarin.org. The free service sends alerts by phone, text, email or smartphone app to registered users when evacuation or other emergency actions are required. Updates are also available at theMarin Public Emergency Portal.</p>
<p>AlertMarin allows registration of up to five addresses including home, work and schools. Listed landline numbers are automatically included, but cellphones and internet-based phone services require manual registration.</p>
<p>If emergency sirens sound on the Tiburon Peninsula, residents should tune to 840AM for emergency information broadcasts. The SNAP radio system — Siren Notification Alerting the Peninsula — provides real-time updates when the peninsula is cut off from outside resources or faces immediate danger.</p>
