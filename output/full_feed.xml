     <title>Everyday Encounters: An ad sales rep has an open-door policy for his Belvedere garage office</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters</link>
     <description>Ed Meagher has been working remotely from his open-door “man cave” since he and his wife moved into their Belvedere Land Co.-owned home three years ago.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those walking down San Rafael Avenue near Community Park on weekdays may notice resident Ed Meagher sitting at his computer in his open garage, faint rock music emanating into the street. Concert posters from The Fillmore line the walls, and a stout bulldog sits at his feet.</p>
<p>Meagher was working out of the garage July 1, just as he does every workday, leaving the garage door open even during the winter.</p>
<p>“I have an option of closing this door and being locked in here,” he says. “But I’d much rather have it open and see people all day long.”</p>
<p>Meagher is an advertising sales rep who has been working remotely from his open-door “man cave” since he and his wife moved into their Belvedere Land Co.-owned home three years ago. Since then, he has gained a reputation in the neighborhood, especially among dog walkers who often stop to chat while their canine counterparts receive treats.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>From prison to podium: Tiburon man finds second chance at life through running</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/from-prison-to-podium-tiburon-man-finds-second-chance-at-life-through-running</link>
     <description>Markelle Taylor began running in 2015 while incarcerated at San Quentin Rehabilitation Center, where he was quickly dubbed “Markelle The Gazelle.”</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the path to becoming a gold-medal long-distance runner, Tiburon resident Markelle Taylor says he’s learned how to overcome adversity.</p>
<p>He likens taking on life’s challenges to lifting weights.</p>
<p>“It’s the pain and the suffering you go through in that and your muscles getting weaker and fatigued, but then you have a resting period, and it builds back stronger,” Taylor says. “And that’s what I’m doing.”</p>
<p>Taylor, 52, began running in 2015 while incarcerated at San Quentin Rehabilitation Center, where he joined the facility’s 1,000 Mile Club and was quickly dubbed “Markelle The Gazelle.” He ran several marathons during his incarceration, using his time from his last prison marathon to qualify for the 2019 Boston Marathon after his release that year.</p>
<p>Since then, he estimates he’s run a dozen marathons across the U.S. and internationally, with a personal best time of 2 hours, 48 minutes. In March, he helped the U.S. win gold as part of a three-man 10K team at the World Masters Athletics Indoor Championships in Florida.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon fire budget plans for Paradise Drive station remodel to start in August</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-fire-budget-plans-for-paradise-drive-station-remodel-to-start-in-august</link>
     <description>The remodel of Station 10 on Paradise Drive at Trestle Glen Boulevard accounts for about 22% of the district’s total anticipated expenditures in fiscal 2026.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Fire Protection District’s $16.7-million budget for fiscal 2025-2026 includes $3.6 million toward the planned remodel of its Paradise Drive station, with construction set to begin in August, along with repairs and upgrades to its downtown station.</p>
<p>The district’s board of directors unanimously approved the break-even budget June 24 ahead of the new fiscal year, which began July 1.</p>
<p>The remodel of Station 10 on Paradise Drive at Trestle Glen Boulevard accounts for about 22% of the district’s total anticipated expenditures in fiscal 2026 and has been in the works for several years. It was originally built in the 1960s as a two-stall station for volunteer firefighters and has since expanded to about 4,000 square feet to include living quarters for on-duty staff and additional fire apparatus.</p>
<p>The district, which serves the town southeast of Trestle Glen Boulevard, unincorporated Tiburon along Paradise Drive and all of Belvedere, will replace the current building with a 4,952-square-foot station and 124-square-foot training tower. The main building will include an apparatus bay for two vehicles with a decontamination room and a 2,485-square-foot living area with five dorms, three gender-neutral bathrooms, an office, dining room, kitchen, gym, laundry room and dayroom.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>NASA ember-risk maps show threats to Tiburon homes</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/nasa-ember-risk-maps-show-threats-to-tiburon-homes</link>
     <description>New satellite data highlights areas where vegetation could fuel 
spot fires; agencies promote defensible space to minimize risks</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA Ames Research Center has released new maps showing Tiburon Peninsula areas at risk from flying embers during wildfires, with zones along the western and southern Tiburon Ridge, Ring Mountain and Angel Island highlighted as potential sources of dangerous firebrands.</p>
<p>NASA earth scientist Chris Potter said embers — glowing, hot particles of vegetation that float through the air during wildfire — pose a threat to Tiburon homes this fire season.</p>
<p>“The wind blows and casts the embers toward your town,” he said. “Toward the roofs and vents of your homes — which are the most dangerous places for an ember to land.”</p>
<p>NASA, in collaboration with the nonprofit Santa Clara County FireSafe Council, released maps in June that display Bay Area spots at greatest risk of sparking flying embers. Using satellite data collected since the 1970s, the maps show dark red regions where vegetation type and density are particularly ember-prone, including areas that border the southern Tiburon Ridge, Acacia Drive, Seafirth, Norman Estates, Del Madera, Hacienda Heights, Mount Tiburon, Upper Sugarloaf and Marinero, Vistazo West, Hill Haven and Lyford Cove/Old Tiburon neighborhoods. Along the western ridge, near Highway 101, ember-prone areas abut the Eagle Rock, Bayview Terrace, Upper Via Los Altos, Tiburon Crest and Reedlands neighborhoods.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>A NASA satellite map released in June shows ember risk levels across the North Bay, with darker red areas indicating vegetation most likely to produce dangerous flying embers during wildfires, with an inset highlighting the Tiburon Peninsula. The map combines decades of satellite data to identify where vegetation types and density create the highest risk for embers that can travel one to two miles from wildfire sources to threaten homes.

     <description>Highlow Larder reflects owner Elizabeth Smith-Finders&apos; journey from social work to Michelin-starred kitchens.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elizabeth Smith-Finders has traveled around the world honing her culinary skills, learning from industry titans, interning at three-starred Michelin restaurants and cooking dishes for ultra-wealthy clientele.</p>
<p>Those experiences taught her that cooking and entertaining can involve “a lot of gatekeeping,” contrasting with her belief that everyone should have access to shared moments around the table.</p>
<p>“I think that it’s one of the most beautiful things that we have are those traditions and those interactions, and I want people to feel really empowered and proud to host and to gather at wherever they’re at,” she says.</p>
<p>That philosophy led Smith-Finders, 44, to Highlow Larder. She founded and owns the cooking and home-goods store that opened May 31 at 32 Main St., replacing Knit House on Main.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing up in Charlotte, North Carolina, and moving to the Bay Area at 19, Rand Crook says he was inspired to attend film school by his experiences as a child actor in commercials.

<p>He attended San Francisco State University’s film program, leading him to connect with director Rob Nilsson, with whom he worked on films including “On the Edge,” “Heat and Sunlight” and “Chalk,” an indie classic involving a lazy yet gifted pool hustler who takes on a high-stakes contender after learning his stepfather has cancer.

     <title>Strawberry rec district plans for deficit to finance new playground</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-rec-district-plans-for-deficit-to-finance-new-playground</link>
     <description>The district aims to have the new playground complete by summer 2026.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Strawberry Recreation District is projecting a nearly $850,000 deficit this fiscal year, driven primarily by the cost of building a new playground at its East Strawberry Drive facility.</p>
<p>The district’s board of directors voted unanimously in May to approve the $4.32 million budget for fiscal 2025-2026, which began July 1. That’s against an anticipated $3.47 million in revenue, for a deficit of $848,372.</p>
<p>General Manager Nancy Shapiro said the deficit is planned, as the district knew it would have to dip into reserves to pay for the new play area. The playground is planned for the second floor of the facility outside the gym’s south entrance, to replace Reggie Park. That playground, located between the main building and tennis courts, was removed to make way for a new sport court for pickleball and basketball that opened in September 2024.</p>
<p>The playground cost is estimated at about $1 million, which Shapiro said is based on observing excavation costs to build the sport court and her conversations with playground companies. The district aims to have the new playground complete by summer 2026, though there’s currently no firm timeline for construction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Notes from an Appraiser: Playful skeleton imagery marks unique period in Japanese garment design</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/notes-from-an-appraiser-playful-skeleton-imagery-marks-unique-period-in-japanese-garment-design</link>
     <description>Most of the kimono designs featuring skulls seem to be a nod to the literary world. The skeletons, on the other hand, are humorous and playful, like those seen in the sketches of Japanese painter and caricaturist.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last two months I have been obsessed with Japanese skeleton kimonos. I was approached by a collector to appraise his 47-piece textile collection, all detailed in the scholarly essay “As We Are Now So Shall You One Day Be” by Jacqueline Atkins. Each of the kimonos has at least two photos, if not more, with commentary by Atkins discussing the motif or a link to an artist known for similar images. These kimonos are very rare and appeared on the Japanese market from 1920 to 1930, the Taishō period to the start of the Shōwa period. It was a time of world peace and exchange of ideas, architecture and modes of travel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>“The Art of Kathy Gray” is on display in at Tiburon Town Hall July 7-Aug. 27. An artist’s reception is planned for 6-8 p.m. July 8.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back when Kathy Gray was painting commissioned portraits, she started to think about ways to show prospective clients how true-to-life she could make her art look. She figured if people didn’t know the person she painted, they would not know if it was a good likeness, so she chose to paint a man almost everyone would recognize: Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>That portrait, which measures about 4 feet by 6 feet, greets visitors to a new Tiburon Town Hall exhibit of Gray’s work, “The Art of Kathy Gray,” on display in the upstairs gallery July 7-Aug. 27. An artist’s reception is planned for 6-8 p.m. July 8.</p>
<p>Among the other paintings on display in the show will be a portrait of Walt Disney. Gray says she happened to be thinking of all the joy Disney had brought to the world when she saw a photograph of the entrepreneur. In that photo, Disney is holding some papers, but Gray substituted Mickey Mouse in her painting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>New laws target gate hazards, throttle e-bikes for kids and distracted driving</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/new-laws-target-gate-hazards-throttle-e-bikes-for-kids-and-distracted-driving</link>
     <description>The local gate ordinance went into effect July 1 after being approved by the Town Council in May 2023.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new Tiburon rule now requires large gates to be outfitted with safeguards to prevent them from falling and potentially injuring or killing someone. The local ordinance joins a Marin-wide ban on throttle e-bikes for kids and a statewide ban on holding a phone while driving among new laws in place for the second half of 2025.</p>
<p>The local gate ordinance went into effect July 1 after being approved by the Town Council in May 2023. It requires property owners to ensure their vehicle and other automated and manual gates have posts that hold them upright if they become untethered from their tracks.</p>
<p>Any gate more than 48 inches wide or 84 inches tall must meet the standards and be designed, built and installed to:</p>
<p>Not fall over more than 45 degrees from a vertical plane when the gate is detached from supporting hardware.</p>
<p>Be balanced and not move under its own weight or by gravity.</p>
<p>Have covered rolling wheels, if applicable, to ensure they move smoothly.</p>
<p>Have positive stops to control the open and closed positions.</p>
<p>Gates must be inspected and certified at least once every five years.</p>
<p>The law was approved after urgings from former Greenbrae couple Eric and Dayna Quanbeck, whose 7-year-old son Alex was killed at Mark Day School in Terra Linda in December 2019 when a 450-pound metal rolling gate fell and hit him on the back of the head. Alex had tried to pull it shut during recess so the football that he and his classmates were tossing around would stay in the yard.</p>
<p>Tiburon Building Official Doug Haight said June 25 that the town has enforced the ordinance for all new gates, including requiring property owners undertaking remodels or having their home inspected to obtain a letter indicating their gate is certified.</p>
<p>“Part of what we’re going to be doing to try and gain compliance is try and educate people of their obligation under the ordinance,” he said.</p>
<p>Haight said there will be a reminder in an upcoming Tiburon Talk newsletter and that officials plan to send courtesy notices after they finish compiling a list of gates across town.</p>
<p>Enforcement will ultimately be determined in coordination with Town Manager Greg Chanis, who was on vacation and not available for comment by The Ark’s press deadline, Haight said, and whoever is hired as community development director to replace Dina Tasini, who left the role last month.</p>
<p>E-bike bans for kids go into effect across Marin</p>

     <title>Tiburon couple brings art, film to Marin County Fair</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-couple-brings-art-film-to-marin-county-fair</link>
     <description>In duo’s first exhibit together, recycled insect installation and a life-spanning short reflect decades of creative work.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A creative Tiburon couple — one a filmmaker and the other a sculptor — will each be featured at this year’sMarin County Fair, which runs July 2-6.</p>
<p>Cynthia Jensen, 77, widely known for her eco-inspired sculpture work, will display a series of insect sculptures made from recycled materials. Her husband, Harris Cohen, 88, whose decades-long film work includes editing Vietnam War footage for CBS and production for local station KPIX Channel 5, will show a short documentary at the fair. The exhibit coincides with this year’s fair theme, “Bug-Tastic.”</p>
<p>Cohen’s short film, “Passages: A Video Memoir,” shows at 6:15 p.m. July 3 at the Showcase Theater during the three-film Doc-Fest, part of the fair’s daily film festival. It traces his career as a videographer, producer and filmmaker. Originally created as a retrospective for his 87th birthday, Cohen said the film was intended for his grandchildren to understand more about his background.</p>
<p>Jensen’s artwork, which explores humankind’s impact on insect populations, will be displayed from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. July 2-6 in John MacLeod’s Virtual Reality booth in the fair’s exhibit hall. She said visitors can scan QR codes for information about various bugs. Her sculptures span more than 40 insects, including dragonflies, beetles, mosquitos and ladybugs. The display will also feature deep-sea exploration, including footage of the Cordell Bank off Point Reyes National Seashore, coral reefs and marine sanctuaries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon to hire designer for neighborhood park upgrades</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-to-hire-designer-for-neighborhood-park-upgrades</link>
     <description>The work will focus on neighborhood miniparks at Cypress Hollow Park, Belveron Mini Park and the Bel Aire play area.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon plans to hire a landscape designer to explore updates for its neighborhood miniparks at Cypress Hollow Park, Belveron Mini Park and the Bel Aire play area, continuing the town’s directive to upgrade its parks.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously June 18 to approve a request for proposals to design the spaces. Community feedback for all parks indicated a need for greater maintenance and upkeep, with parks commissioners noting resident support for a new swing set for all children instead of the current toddler-only swings at Cypress Hollow Park, two to three benches at the Bel Aire space and removing flammable trees at Belveron Mini Park.</p>
<p>Public Works Engineering Manager David Eshoo said after the meeting that the timeline is in its early stages, but he hopes the Town Council can approve a design by September with Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission approval beforehand.</p>]]></content:encoded>
