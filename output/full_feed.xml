     <title>Town adds $500,000 to parks fund in $26 mil draft budget</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/town-adds-500-000-to-parks-fund-in-26-mil-draft-budget</link>
     <description>The draft includes an $18.25 million operating budget for day-to-day expenses and a $6.48 million capital-improvement program for infrastructure upgrades.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Town Council requested an additional $500,000 be moved from general reserves to a dedicated parks fund during its June 4 budget review, responding to criticism from parents that the town’s $200,000 allocation for future park amenities was insufficient.</p>
<p>That comes as the town is already including an additional $100,000 for neighborhood park maintenance contracts as part of its $25.97 million draft budget for fiscal 2025-2026, which includes an $18.25 million operating budget for day-to-day expenses and a $6.48 million capital-improvement program for infrastructure upgrades.</p>
<p>“It demonstrates that they are listening to the community and making a serious commitment to improving our parks system,” said Tiburon resident Jenna McKnight, a member of the grassroots Parents for Parks and Rec advocacy group. “While we recognize there are still many steps ahead, tonight’s decision was an important step in the direction of enhancing outdoor life across the generations in Tiburon.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Marine lab gets six-month reprieve amid discussion of takeover by foundation</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/marine-lab-gets-six-month-reprieve-amid-discussion-of-takeover-by-foundation</link>
     <description>SF State first announced in February that it would shutter the 53-acre Estuary &amp; Ocean Science Center due to budget cuts.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon’s Estuary & Ocean Science Center has been granted a six-month reprieve while San Francisco State University administrators explore an alternative to closing its doors.</p>
<p>The university first announced in February that it would shutter the 53-acre marine biology station due to budget cuts, but that decision has been pushed back until at least January 2026, university officials say, while they discuss long-term options with representatives from an unnamed foundation.</p>
<p>Bobby King, the university’s director of communications, confirmed by email June 5 that options include covering short-term expenses or turning over the facility entirely.</p>
<p>“We would consider the possibility of selling the campus, especially if it allowed the continuation of the kinds of (research) activities currently happening,” he said. “We expect to know more about what’s next at some point in the next six months.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>School board urges Bel Aire to explore keeping overnight diversity camp</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/school-board-urges-bel-aire-to-explore-keeping-overnight-diversity-camp</link>
     <description>The principal&apos;s recommendation to suspend the Mosaic Project camp sparked outcry among many parents.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reed Union School District board members have directed Bel Aire Elementary School officials to explore ways to continue the school’s longstanding partnership with The Mosaic Project overnight camp through next year, despite a principal’s recommendation to pause the program.</p>
<p>Principal John DiCosmo had recommended temporarily suspending the four-night diversity camp for fourth graders starting next year. He cited cost concerns, staffing difficulties, safety concerns among some parents, equity issues for students who choose not to participate and questions about how consistently the camp’s lessons were being integrated into classrooms.</p>
<p>The recommendation sparked outcry among many parents who said the experience had been fundamental in their children’s growth.</p>
<p>At the district board’s June 3 meeting, board members directed DiCosmo and district Superintendent Kimberly McGrath to work with representatives from Mosaic to address the district’s concerns and provide an opportunity for students to attend next year while the school continues exploring alternatives.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Reed district hires firm to survey voters on bond measure</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-district-hires-firm-to-survey-voters-on-bond-measure</link>
     <description>The potential potential November 2026 bond measure would pay for facilities upgrades across three campuses.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Reed Union School District will spend up to $25,750 to gauge voter support for a potential November 2026 bond measure that would pay for facilities upgrades across its three campuses.</p>
<p>The district’s board of trustees voted unanimously June 3 to contract with Oakland-based research firm Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz & Associates to conduct the survey. The poll will provide the board with data to help decide whether to seek a bond, in what amount and when to place a measure on the ballot. Survey costs will be paid from the district’s facilities fund, a restricted pot of money kept separate from the general fund that pays for day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz & Associates, or FM3, will work with the district to design and conduct the survey of up to 300 district residents likely to vote in the November 2026 election. The survey would be conducted by telephone and online, with interviews lasting an average of 18 minutes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Longtime nursery schools leader Marilyn Knight was civic volunteer, helped launch The Ark</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/longtime-nursery-schools-leader-marilyn-knight-was-civic-volunteer-helped-launch-the-ark</link>
     <description>Marilyn Knight died of breast cancer May 24 at her Tiburon home. She was 91.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marilyn Knight, who helped conceive The Ark and served in leadership and consulting roles at the Belvedere-Hawthorne Nursery Schools for more than 35 years, died of breast cancer May 24 at her Tiburon home. She was 91.</p>
<p>Knight spent 18 years as a director at the nursery schools from 1968 to 1986, including the last five years as executive director. She introduced the first pre-kindergarten program in Southern Marin with Hawthorne Pre-K when she first started, said longtime friend and onetime colleague Annelies Atchley of Belvedere. After stepping down as executive director, she continued consulting for the school until 2004. Some of the curriculum she developed is still in use today.</p>
<p>Kathleen Walker Parker, the current head of school and a former executive director at Belvedere-Hawthorne, was hired by Knight in 1984. Parker said the best way to learn in early childhood education is by example, and Knight “did just that.”</p>
<p>“She knew how to lead by example and how to teach best practices with early childhood education,” Parker said. “She was a natural at storytelling and getting down at children’s levels to share.”</p>
<p>Knight was deeply involved in the community beyond her work at the nursery schools, with decades of volunteer work with religious organizations, social services and civic groups.</p>
<p>In 1972, the idea for a new community newspaper emerged at Knight’s Hill Haven home when a group of Tiburon Peninsula residents was making last-minute signs and banners for the Ayala Day picnic at Angel Island. They began venting their frustrations that the existing paper, the Ebb Tide, refused to run a news announcement.</p>
<p>“The idea just popped out. I don’t even remember who said it first,” Knight told The Ark for a 40th anniversary retrospective article in 2013. “We thought, ‘Why couldn’t we just get the group of people together and do it?’ We wanted a paper of the people and by the people and for the community.”</p>
<p>Knight became the first subscriber when the first of two 1972 sample editions was laid out on her and late husband Jeff’s kitchen table ahead of The Ark’s first formal issue Jan. 10, 1973.</p>
<p>Knight was born Marilyn Valerie Sanchez-Corea on Oct. 6, 1933, in San Francisco to dental surgeon Antonio Sanchez-Corea and teacher Helen McCarty. Her father was born in Guatemala and moved to the U.S. at age 10, later bringing his dental practice to Tiburon about 1960. Her mother was raised in San Francisco and was of Ir...</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tiburon resident Jennifer Freker laughs as she wrestles a ball from the 5-year-old dog during a walk at Belvedere Community Park on June 4. For Freker, 38, it’s a typical day as a stay-at-home mother who often walks Disney before picking up her youngest from nursery school.</p>
<p>With her kids at ages 8, 6 and 3, “I think I’m through the darkest days,” she says, “at least until the teenage years.”</p>

     <title>Reed district to revamp free meals with healthier and better-tasting food</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-district-to-revamp-free-meals-with-healthier-and-better-tasting-food</link>
     <description>Officials noted complaints about both the overall quality of the food and the amount of waste in much of the packaging.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Reed Union School District is revamping its free breakfast and lunch program for the 2025-2026 school year in hopes of providing healthier, better-tasting meals to its students.</p>
<p>The district has ended its contract with current food vendor, San Carlos-based The LunchMaster, and will instead contract with local catering company Dee’s Organics, which operates out of Kentfield, to run its on-campus meal program. The district’s board of directors voted unanimously at its June 3 meeting to approve the estimated $715,646 contract with Dee’s Organics to provide some 132,271 lunches and 100,553 breakfasts between August and June.</p>
<p>That accounts for not only the Reed students expected to take advantage of the meal program but also covers breakfast and lunch distribution in the Ross and Kentfield school districts, which go through the Reed district to obtain their meals. The free meal program is fully funded through state and federal reimbursements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oct. 6, 1933 - May 24, 2025</p>
<p>Marilyn Sanchez-Corea Knight, beloved, wife, mother and Nonie to her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, passed away peacefully at her home on May 24 surrounded by her family. Born in San Francisco to Antonio and Helene Sanchez-Corea, she was the first of four children. She graduated from the Convent of the Sacred Heart in 1951 and from Stanford University in 1955 with a degree in Child Psychology. In 1954, Marilyn found the love of her life in Geoffrey Knight and they married in 1955.</p>
<p>Marilyn went on to a career of education, earning a master’s degree from the University of San Francisco in Early Childhood Education. She and Geoff had two children, Jocelyn and Geoffrey, and in 1963 moved from San Francisco to Tiburon, where they formed a large community of friends.</p>
<p>Marilyn taught pre-school in Marin City and then went on to become a director, executive director and educational consultant of the Belvedere-Hawthorne Nursery School from 1968 to 2004. She created curricula that are still used today. She was famous for her Mornings with Marilyn discussions with new parents in her home.</p>
<p>A parishioner of St. Hilary’s Catholic Church for 62 years, she and Geoff led seminars for Wedding Prep parishioners. Marilyn also served as a Lector and Eucharistic Minister. She was a member of the Ministry of Consolation, Parish Council and Social Justice at San Quentin.</p>
<p>Some of the numerous charities she supported were: St. Vincent de Paul, as a board member for Marin Homeless in Action, Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology fund-raising committee, and Homebound, where she supported children in Guatemala for decades.</p>
<p>Marilyn was a faithful, well-educated Catholic devoted to assistance to the sick and poor. With 23 years membership in the Order of Malta, Marilyn was a leading participant in the Growing the Faith program for marginalized children in Marin County, California, where she oversaw the preparation of curricula, the teaching and provision of age-appropriate Catholic books and materials for school children K-8.</p>
<p>Marilyn was also a generous benefactor of the Northern California Clinic of the Order of Malta, The Global Fund for Forgotten People of the Order of Malta and numerous works of charity sponsored by the local order. Marilyn participated in eight Lourdes pilgrimages.</p>

     <title>State moving forward with bike lanes on Tiburon Boulevard</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/state-moving-forward-with-bike-lanes-on-tiburon-boulevard</link>
     <description>Caltrans announced a two-phase approach that would include bike lanes next year and enhancements in 2027-2028.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caltrans officials say a controversial bike-lane project on Tiburon Boulevard must proceed as planned in early 2026, citing funding deadlines and concerns that winter storms could further damage the deteriorating roadway.</p>
<p>While rumors had swirled ahead of the Tiburon Town Council’sspecial June 4 meetingthat Caltrans had already decided to delay the project for two years, the state agency instead announced atwo-phase approach: implementing basic improvements including bike lanes next year, followed by enhanced safety features in a second phase beginning in fiscal year 2027-2028.</p>
<p>The4.6-mile projectspans state-owned Highway 131 from outside Mill Valley to Tiburon Boulevard’s intersection with Main Street. Caltrans has $12.7 million in construction funding that officials said could be lost if the project is delayed.</p>
<p>“What we have right now is very limited, we understand that,” said Wajahat Nyaz, Caltrans’ Bay Area district deputy director for project design. A second phase will feature community collaboration “to find these kinds of solutions that we can fund and that can also improve safety.”</p>
<p>Project details and timeline</p>
<p>The project primarily involves repaving the road due to deteriorating conditions. But Caltrans’Complete Streetsdirective requires the agency to consider improvements for pedestrians and cyclists alongside drivers.</p>
<p>A combination of separated, mixed-use Class-1 paths, painted Class-2 bike lanes and protected Class-4 bikeways would be added from outside Mill Valley to Trestle Glen Boulevard on the north side and to Blackie’s Pasture on the south side.</p>
<p>Caltrans’project-initiation report of 2019for funding in 2020 included painted lanes as a “top-tier priority,” with an option for protected bikeways from Highway 101 to Trestle Glen and Blackie’s. The report specifically cites recommendations from Tiburon’s2012 Bay Trail gap studyand2016 bicycle-and-pedestrian master-plan update, along withMarinandCaltrans master plans of 2018. Later, Tiburon in 2023 approved recommendations for protected bikeways as part of itsCreate Tiburon 2040 general plan.</p>
<p>The lanes primarily became protected, with physical barriers separating cyclists from traffic, after further discussion with advocacy groups including Marin Safe Routes to Schools and were part of thedraft initial studyreleased in 2023.</p>
<p>Under plans advocated by Safe Routes, Caltrans and historically by the town, the addition of bike lanes on ...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon plans to spend $6.43 million on capital-improvement projects in the 2025-2026 fiscal year, with about $1.06 million earmarked for parks improvements as the town begins implementing its long-term vision for parks, recreation and open spaces.</p>
<p>Among the projects are fixing Tiburon’s steps, lanes and paths; replacing the bridge along the Old Rail Trail toward downtown Tiburon; adding wayfinding signs throughout the town; rehabbing Lyford Tower’s roof; and an early $200,000 commitment toward overall parks amenities and improvements.</p>
<p>The Planning Commission reviewed the capital-improvement program May 28 and voted 3-0 to find it conforms with Tiburon’s general plan. Chair Kathleen Defever and Vice Chair Daniel Amir were absent.</p>
<p>The Town Council will review the program tonight, June 4, as part of the wider budget review for the new fiscal year, which starts July 1. The council is expected to adopt the budget, including capital projects, June 18.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>Caltrans plans to create bikeways on the north and south sides of Tiburon Boulevard as part of its 2026 repaving and rehabilitation project that extends from Mill Valley to downtown Paradise Drive. The blue segments represent Class-2 bike lanes, or marked on-road lanes alongside traffic that don’t have a physical barrier; the red segments are Class-4 separated bikeways, which are also on the roadway but protected from traffic; and the gold segment is a Class-1 bike path, which is away from the road, like the Old Rail Trail.

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon’s top sustainability official says she believes the town is still on track to meet its ambitious goal of reducing emissions to 50% below 1990 levels, but residents will need to pivot away from gas-powered vehicles and appliances.</p>
<p>Grace Ledwith, the shared climate action and sustainability coordinator for Tiburon and Mill Valley, delivered her annual update on Tiburon’s Climate Action Plan at the Town Council’s May 21 meeting.</p>
<p>The 126-page plan, adopted in September 2022, outlines strategies, time frames, staffing resources, greenhouse-gas reductions and key metrics with its emission-reduction goal — stronger than the 40% reduction set by the state in 2016. That will require slashing 21,000 metric tons of carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Ledwith said two of the big actions that can help Tiburon meet its goal are “really getting folks out of their single-occupancy gas-powered vehicles” and having people switch from gas- to electric-powered appliances.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon police to stick with detective role after trial run</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-police-to-stick-with-detective-role-after-trial-run</link>
     <description>“We’ve had great success solving three or four major cases,” Police Chief Michelle Jean said.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Police Department has officially resurrected its long-vacant detective role after a six-month trial in which the sergeant serving in the position helped make arrests in a robbery case of CVS/pharmacy and a serial shoplifting case at Nugget Market, among others, officials say.</p>
<p>Sgt. Rob Law will stay in the role indefinitely, though it will remain a specialty assignment rather than a permanent position within the force, Capt. Jarrod Yee said in an email. Law will retain his position as sergeant, one of the department’s four, while continuing to earn special assignment pay of $315 per month, or $3,780 per year, which he has been receiving since he took on the role in January.</p>
<p>“We’ve had great success solving three or four major cases,” Police Chief Michelle Jean said at a May 20 meeting of her Citizens Advisory Panel.</p>]]></content:encoded>
