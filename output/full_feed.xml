      <title>Agency pulls two tons of debris from Richardson Bay</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/agency-pulls-two-tons-of-debris-from-richardson-bay</link>
      <description>The cleanup is in support of a plan to revitalize ecologically vital eelgrass beds damaged by long-term anchoring.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two small boats, a shopping cart, a PlayStation, outboard engines, portable generators, a baseball bat, an office chair, a floor lamp, an electric keyboard, multiple anchors and a microwave.</p>
<p>Those items were among the more than two tons of debris scuba divers working for the Richardson Bay Regional Agency pulled up from the bay floor last month during a weeklong cleanup of the newly established eelgrass protection zone, according to officials.</p>
<p>The cleanup is in support of a plan to revitalize ecologically vital eelgrass beds damaged by long-term anchoring on Richardson Bay. Last October, the agency officially declared a 300-acre portion of the bay off limits to anchoring and has committed to restoring 15 acres of eelgrass by 2027.</p>
<p>The April cleanup targeted only one acre of bay floor, but future cleanups are planned for later in May and in the summer, officials said.</p>
<p>“Sadly, I’m not surprised at the amount of debris and discarded items we removed from the bay floor,” regional agency Executive Director Brad Gross said in a prepared statement. “We are not accusing anyone of deliberately discarding items overboard. That said, the type and amount of debris littering the bay floor … reinforces the fact that an environmentally sensitive area like Richardson Bay is no place for mariners to permanently reside on vessels at anchor.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>‘Utter disgrace’: Peninsula residents vent over latest power failure</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/utter-disgrace-peninsula-residents-vent-over-latest-power-failure</link>
      <description>A fallen tree in Strawberry knocked out power to more than 4,000 Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers across the Tiburon Peninsula.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fallen tree in Strawberry knocked out power to more than 4,000 Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers across the Tiburon Peninsula May 6-7, leaving residents frustrated with what they describe as deteriorating service despite rising utility bills.</p>
<p>Customers across all of Belvedere, segments of Strawberry, Greenwood Cove Drive, Greenwood Beach Road, and the Old Tiburon, downtown Tiburon, Round Hill, Del Mar and Hawthorne Terrace neighborhoods lost power beginning about 8:50 p.m., according to PG&E’s online outage tracker. Most of the peninsula had power restored by 11:43 p.m., nearly three hours after the outage was first logged, though several reported power fluctuations throughout the evening.</p>
<p>Some 486 customers near 45 Reed Blvd., where the tree fell onto the power line, didn’t see their electricity restored until about 6:45 a.m. May 7, nearly 10 hours after the outage began, according to PG&E incident reports.</p>
<p>“What is going on with back-to-back power cuts in Belvedere and Tiburon?” Round Hill resident Annie Joseph posted on community forum Nextdoor, later adding: “The infrastructure is an utter disgrace.”</p>
<p>The social media platform filled with complaints from residents, including some who missed the Golden State Warriors’ playoff victory that evening because of the blackout.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <media:description>Tiburon resident Ray Lynch drops off vegetation cuttings he collected from around the neighborhood at Blackie’s Pasture on May 10 for the first free Chipper Day of the year. Hosted by the Tiburon Fire Protection District and Tiburon Department of Public Works, residents can drop off cuttings and tree stumps for free to help protect the community against wildfires. Staff and volunteers who collected the vegetation with tractors and piled it into containers estimated a total of 400 cubic yards would be collected by the end of the day, one of the highest volumes in recent years. The event runs 9 a.m.-4 p.m. on second Saturdays through September, with the next on June 14. (Leo Leung / For The Ark)</media:description>

      <description>Ann T. Morrison died peacefully on May 5, 2025.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ann T. Morrison died peacefully on May 5, 2025. Her poetic last words were, “I’m ready to get on the airplane now.” Born in Evanston, IL, and only child of Eleanor and Joseph Morrison, she grew up in Pasadena, CA, where she attended Poly and West Ridge schools, and graduated from San Francisco State University with a degree in English. She moved to Belvedere in 1955. Ann taught elementary school in Marin at Bel Aire, Marin Country Day, and Wade Thomas schools. She held numerous volunteer jobs, including helping Judge David Baty develop a docent program in the courts for students. She also served on the board of the Belvedere Tennis Club, and as a member of the Alliance to Save Our Hospital. She loved the old days of photography doing her own developing and printing. Her passion was cruising on the small ships of The Seabourn and The Silver Seas. Her favorite place of all to be was her apartment over the water in Belvedere Cove where she lived for an amazing 51 years. She is survived by East Coast relatives the Andersons and the Mahoneys. She also enjoyed wonderful years of friendship with Erica McAuliffe and Nathan Good. She would like if everyone who reads this shares a fun surprise or little gift with a friend. She was 89 years old and will be missed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>The show, “We Know Who We Are,” will have an artists’ reception 6-8 p.m. May 13.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From left, ‘The Healing’ by Henry Frank,‘Potato Famine Si! Tortillas No’ by Marty Meadeand ‘Walk’n My Talk’ by Alicia Retes are part of the ‘We Know Who We Are’ exhibit at Tiburon Town Hall featuring artists with indigenous roots.</p>
<p>Indigenous artists from around the Bay Area have their works on display in “We Know Who We Are,” showing at Tiburon Town Hall through June 24.</p>
<p>The show, which will have an artists’ reception 6-8 p.m. May 13, is part of an ongoing effort by the Tiburon Heritage and Arts Commission to highlight artists from underrepresented backgrounds, including artists of color, women and LGBTQ+ artists and artists from different socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>
<p>One of the artists in the show is Novato resident Henry Frank, a 51-year-old who spent 20 years in federal prisons from age 19 to 39.</p>
<p>Frank’s father was of Yurok and Pomo heritage, while his mother was Yurok, Karuk, Tolowa, Dutch and Spanish. His parents split up when he was 5, and he and his younger brother lived with their mother, who battled substance-abuse issues.</p>
<p>“I had to learn to cook and take care of my brother because my mother was always high on heroin,” he says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The agency behind the Yellow Bus Challenge will introduce a pilot late-afternoon route next school year to bring Reed Union district students home from after-school programs and tutoring sessions.</p>
<p>The new route, unanimously approved by the newly renamed Tiburon Peninsula Traffic Alliance board May 2, will leave Bel Aire Elementary School at 4 p.m. and make five stops along Tiburon Boulevard before reaching Reed Elementary School. The bus will then make eight more stops on its return journey before heading out to Paradise Drive via Highway 101, dropping remaining riders in east Corte Madera and Paradise Cay.</p>
<p>It will be the day’s last service for the same bus used earlier in the afternoon to take home St. Hilary Catholic School students, another service that received unanimous approval at the meeting.</p>
<p>Alongside the route expansions, the agency recently announced its rebranding as the Tiburon Peninsula Traffic Alliance to better reflect its broader mission, though the Tiburon Peninsula Traffic Relief Joint Powers Agency, formed in 2016, remains its formal name.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tiburon teen has launched a fundraising effort to ensure all students in the Sausalito-Marin City School District have access to a home computer.</p>
<p>Natty Gove launched the nonprofitTech4Youth Foundationin February and is aiming to raise $11,000 to purchase laptops for 30 students in need.</p>
<p>The Redwood High School sophomore notes about 90% of his homework requires a computer, making him realize how much more difficult it would be to succeed in school if he didn’t have his own at home.</p>
<p>“I just realized basically that in an ever more digitized world, access to this technology is not so much of a luxury as it was pre-COVID, it’s more of a necessity,” says Natty, 15, adding that students who don’t have computers at home can easily fall behind through no fault of their own.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Tiburon reminds Laura Parkinson of her hometown of Hallettsville, Texas, about 120 miles east of San Antonio.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laura Parkinson is taking a break from her busy work and home schedule as she sits on a bench on the banks below McKegney Green April 29.</p>
<p>As LinkedIn’s head of brand experience, Parkinson had decided to shut off her laptop after an intense workday to walk and meditate — “very uncharacteristic of me,” she says. She says she’s lucky her employer supports discretionary time off, but it’s a busy time of year, and that makes the work-life balance a little tougher to find.</p>
<p>“The sounds, the smells of the ocean, just the visuals of the blue water … it’s not lost on me,” Parkinson says as she takes in the view. “I feel so fortunate to be able to step away from the computer to this, you know?”</p>
<p>Tiburon reminds Parkinson of her hometown of Hallettsville, Texas, about 120 miles east of San Antonio. She says the town, settled by Czech and German immigrants, features traditional small-town characteristics with everyone knowing everyone, plus rolling hills, cattle and oil drilling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Katherine McLaughlin</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/katherine-mclaughlin</link>
      <description>Katherine Clifford Higgins McLaughlin passed away peacefully April 8th, just days after her 90th birthday.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Katherine Clifford Higgins McLaughlin passed away peacefully April 8th, just days after her 90th birthday celebration, surrounded by the love and laughter of her family. It was a celebration filled with glowing tributes and sweet memories — just the way she wanted it. And what a wonderful life she led! Kathie was the proud matriarch of a large, adoring family. She was an elegant woman and a fun-loving, loyal friend. She traveled the world over, developed strong friendships and stayed active and healthy almost to the end.</p>
<p>She was preceded in death by her loving husband, Bob, and truthfully, life lost its luster after he was gone. Their remarkable 67-year marriage was at the very heart of Kathie’s world. Bob just adored her and Kathie’s father told her that Bob McLaughlin was the best thing that ever happened to her. Their bond was one of those beautiful love stories that left a lasting impression on everyone who knew them.</p>
<p>Family was paramount to Kathie, and her greatest joy was spending time with her four children — Marita Daly (Kevin), Mark McLaughlin (Monique Petrov), Florence McLaughlin and Katherine Prodger — and her nine grandchildren, Matt and Elena Daly; Ross (Alli Beach), Whitney, Grace and Francesca McLaughlin; Jake Voien; and Cassie and Marita Prodger. She cherished every detail of their lives.</p>
<p>Born April 6, 1935, Kathie grew up in Summit, New Jersey, and Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania. She is survived by her three siblings, Drew Higgins of South Burlington, VT; Marita Gilliam of Raleigh, NC; and James C. Higgins, Jr. of Wayne, PA. They remember her as a loving and understanding sister who played an important role in their lives, offering them support throughout their years. Kathie particularly cherished her weekly calls with her sister Marita, even though they hadn’t lived near each other their entire adult lives.</p>
<p>She received her nursing degree from Georgetown University, an achievement she held close to her heart for her entire life. She admired the Jesuit values, and instilled in her children a love of learning, a strong work ethic and an endless curiosity about the world.</p>
<p>Though private by nature, Kathie was fun-loving and had a sharp wit and great sense of humor that revealed itself when Bob wasn’t stealing the show. Kathie was a great athlete, enjoying ice skating, skiing, tennis and golf.</p>
<p>Until they settled in Marin County, life took the McLaughlin family all across the country as Bob worked his way...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An undeveloped waterfront parcel on Paradise Drive’s Bluff Point has returned to the market at $8.75 million — exactly what the owner paid for it 25 years ago and a dramatic 81% drop from its highest asking price.</p>
<p>Swedish tech mogul Anders Swahn has listed his 14.73-acre property at 2800 Paradise Drive in unincorporated Tiburon at a steep discount from previous askings of $39 million in 2013 and $47 million in 2021.</p>
<p>The property, which Swahn owns with ex-wife Terri Salvatore-Swahn, according to the San Francisco Standard, sits on one half of the Bluff Point peninsula, with the other half owned by the Keil family. It includes about 2,000 feet of shoreline and carries county approval for an 18,227-square-foot estate, which includes the 15,240-square-foot carbon-neutral main house, a 2,200-square-foot guest house and a 720-square-foot caretaker’s cottage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Couple sues Belvedere over $254K fine for delayed construction</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/couple-sues-belvedere-over-254k-fine-for-delayed-construction</link>
      <description>The claim says the penalty violated their constitutional rights of due process and against excessive fines.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Belvedere couple has filed a federal lawsuit against the city, challenging a nearly quarter-million-dollar fine imposed after their “dream home” renovation project exceeded the city’s construction time limit by more than eight months.</p>
<p>Laurent and Marguerite Lefouet filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on April 25, alleging the $254,400 penalty violated their constitutional rights of due process and against excessive fines. The couple claims city officials’ own delays in processing permit revisions caused much of the project’s tardiness, yet they were still penalized.</p>
<p>“(The Lefouets) worked diligently to complete the project. But their project was repeatedly delayed by Belvedere’s lack of diligence in reviewing and approving project goals, which ultimately led to a failure to complete the project within the arbitrarily short 18-month deadline,” the lawsuit states.</p>
<p>The suit comes as Belvedere is already litigating another suit filed in Marin Superior Court in October 2022 by Golden Gate Avenue resident David Flaherty. He was hit with a $300,000 construction time-limit penalty after his home-renovation project took more than 4½ years to complete. That alleges the city miscalculated extensions for the 2017 Tubbs fire and the COVID-19 pandemic, also while asserting Belvedere unconstitutionally failed to provide due process and assessed excessive fines.</p>
<p>“This is basically a windfall for the city of Belvedere,” the Lefouets’ attorney, Greg Walston of San Francisco-based Walston Law Group, said in an interview, calling the fines an illegal raising of revenue untethered from the city’s actual costs or harm. “They’re getting $300,000 out of Mr. Flaherty. They’re getting $254,000 out of Mr. Lefouet. This is just going to the city coffer and being used for whatever they want it to.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/officials-warn-tiburon-boulevard-bike-lane-plan-risks-bus-stops-traffic-and-safety</link>
      <description>Caltrans’ 2026 project to rehabilitate and repave Tiburon Boulevard includes bike lanes that would eliminate four school-bus stops.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three local agencies say Caltrans’planned bike lanesalong Tiburon Boulevard will eliminate four school-bus stops, jam up traffic and endanger cyclists, adding to mounting criticism of the project’s design and communication process.</p>
<p>The Reed Union School District, Marin Transit and the Tiburon Peninsula Traffic Alliance have all submitted letters opposing aspects of the bike lanes planned between Blackfield Drive and Trestle Glen Boulevard.</p>
<p>In her April 15 letter, Reed district Superintendent Kimberly McGrath said the plan would “imperil bus transportation for a number of students and potentially encourage” them to bike what she calls “a busy transit corridor when a safer route is currently available to all bikes along Greenwood Beach Road.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <media:description>Cyclists ride down Greenwood Beach Road, parallel to Tiburon Boulevard, toward Blackie’s Pasture and the Old Rail Trail on May 4. Local officials say bike traffic is better suited to the street than out on Tiburon Boulevard, where as part of its 2026 project to rehabilitate and repave the road, Caltrans wants to create protected bike lanes on the north and south side of the road from Highway 101 to Trestle Glen Boulevard.

<p>"Impaired driving is preventable," Capt. Jarrod Yee said in a May 2 press release. "It's a choice. If you've been drinking or taken drugs that impair, make the right choice by finding a sober driver or alternate transportation to take you places."</p>
<p>The department said that impairment can come from sources beyond alcohol, including prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs and marijuana, which remains illegal to use while driving despite being legal for recreational and medicinal use in California.</p>
<p>First-time DUI offenders face an average of $13,500 in fines and penalties, plus license suspension, according to the release.</p>
<p>The enforcement effort is funded through a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety via the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Belvedere council OKs new fees to generate $594K more each year</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-council-oks-new-fees-to-generate-594k-more-each-year</link>
      <description>The higher service charges aim to better cover expenses and close growing budget gaps.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere will increase its building and planning fees beginning July 1, a move aimed at allowing the city to recover more costs from development projects and free up general-fund money for citywide initiatives.</p>
<p>The City Council voted unanimously at its April 14 meeting to adopt the new fee structure, which is expected to generate an additional $594,000 annually for the city. The council had previously signaled its intent to approve the new fees at its March meeting.</p>
<p>The increases are based on a study from consultant ClearSource Financial that found Belvedere currently recovers only 53% of costs for services like home remodels and other development projects. The city collects about $1.07 million annually in fee revenues but spends about $2.04 million providing these services, requiring it to pull nearly $968,000 from the general fund to cover the gap.</p>
<p>The new fee structure would immediately increase cost recovery to 82% with a target of reaching 91% in future years through annual inflationary adjustments. Building services would reach 100% cost recovery in the first year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Sticker shock pushes Bel Aire to rethink flood-control plans</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/sticker-shock-pushes-bel-aire-to-rethink-flood-control-plans</link>
      <description>The projected $1.1 million creek design is nearly three times what was anticipated.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Officials working on a flood-prevention project to restore two creeks in Tiburon’s Bel Aire neighborhood have ordered further studies after projected design and environmental-review costs for the work came back at $1.1 million — nearly three times what was anticipated.</p>
<p>The five-member Marin Flood Zone 4 advisory board voted 4-1 April 22, with member Carolyn Shadan dissenting, to direct West Sacramento-based firm CBEC, Inc. to spend $15,000-$20,000 to review information and literature surrounding hydrology and hydraulics at the East and West creeks in hopes of reducing the estimated design costs, which the board had budgeted at about $400,000 and which does not include the $2 million planned for constructing the project.</p>
<p>“It’s a very low-risk investment at this time that could get us closer to … the right direction in terms of overall project costs,” member Liza Gregory Bass said.</p>
<p>Judd Goodman, senior civil engineer with the water resources division at the Marin Public Works Department and the county’s staff liaison, said during the meeting that CBEC will be able to complete their assessment before the board’s next scheduled meeting in July.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>The block party will run 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. May 16, with lower Main Street closed to car traffic.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ranch will celebrate 50 years as Tiburon and Belvedere’s joint recreation agency with two free 1970s-themed events next month: a May 7 trivia night and a May 16 block party on lower Main Street.</p>
<p>The themed trivia night is set for 6:30 p.m. at the Tiburon Tavern, 1651 Tiburon Blvd., with gift cards as prizes. The block party will run 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. downtown, with lower Main Street closed to car traffic from 4 to 9 p.m. to accommodate set up and take down.</p>
<p>The block party will feature dance covers from Shake It Booty Band, a photo booth, games and prizes. There will be a slot machine to win free Ranch merchandise and a booth where attendees can make pet rocks, which were a fad in the 1970s. There will also be birthday cake. Residents can check out The Ranch’s social-media accounts in the days leading up to the celebrations to see old photos from the agency’s early days.</p>
<p>Ranch Executive Director Jessica Hotchkiss said the agency wanted to pay homage to the decade it formed while also creating an event for residents to come together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Owner of The Cove apartments defaults on $210 mil loan as its financial troubles grow</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/owner-of-the-cove-apartments-defaults-on-210-mil-loan-as-its-financial-troubles-grow</link>
      <description>The Tiburon Peninsula property is not Maximus Real Estate Partners’ only troubled asset.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The owners of The Cove at Tiburon, a 283-unit luxury apartment complex on Barbaree Road just outside Tiburon town limits, have reportedly defaulted on a $210 million loan, which could force a sale or foreclosure.</p>
<p>According to multiple Bay Area publications, bond rater Morningstar announced April 1 that San Francisco-based Maximus Real Estate Partners, headed by investor and wine collector Robert “Big Boy” Rosania, defaulted after the loan reached maturity in March.</p>
<p>The Ark could not independently verify the default with Morningstar after a spokesperson declined to comment, but the San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco Business Times and real-estate news outlet The Real Deal all cited Morningstar in reporting on the default. The Business Times also cited notes sent to bondholders.</p>
<p>It remains unclear what future control of the property looks like. Maximus did not respond to multiple emails seeking comment over the past two weeks. Cove complex management also did not respond to messages left by phone or during an impromptu in-person visit to its leasing office last week. One Cove employee said they were unaware of any default involving the complex.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tiburon resident wins silver in world tennis tournament</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-resident-wins-silver-in-world-tennis-tournament</link>
      <description>The former college standout has returned to form in 40-plus doubles.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly five years after she decided to spend more time getting back into competitive tennis, Tiburon resident Angela Lawrence-Hendy is making her mark on the international stage.</p>
<p>The 48-year-old was the runner-up alongside teammate Mariko Fritz-Krockow, 42, of Corte Madera in the 40-and-up women’s doubles event at the International Tennis Federation’s World Individual Championships, held March 15-22 in Manavgat, Turkey. She also captained the Australian 45-and-up women’s team at the Margaret Court Cup as part of the World Team Championships March 9-14 in Manavgat.</p>
<p>Winning the silver medal was amazing, Lawrence-Hendy says, as five years ago, she talked to her husband, James Hendy, about competing in more tennis tournaments and what it would take to get to that level.</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘You know, I’m not really done competing,’” Lawrence-Hendy recalls. “I’d like to see if I can try and make top 50 in the world.”</p>]]></content:encoded>
