     <description>Highlow Larder reflects owner Elizabeth Smith-Finders&apos; journey from social work to Michelin-starred kitchens.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elizabeth Smith-Finders has traveled around the world honing her culinary skills, learning from industry titans, interning at three-starred Michelin restaurants and cooking dishes for ultra-wealthy clientele.</p>
<p>Those experiences taught her that cooking and entertaining can involve “a lot of gatekeeping,” contrasting with her belief that everyone should have access to shared moments around the table.</p>
<p>“I think that it’s one of the most beautiful things that we have are those traditions and those interactions, and I want people to feel really empowered and proud to host and to gather at wherever they’re at,” she says.</p>
<p>That philosophy led Smith-Finders, 44, to Highlow Larder. She founded and owns the cooking and home-goods store that opened May 31 at 32 Main St., replacing Knit House on Main.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Tiburon resident Rand Crook is a writer and film producer whose credits include the 1996 indie movie ‘Chalk.&apos;</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing up in Charlotte, North Carolina, and moving to the Bay Area at 19, Rand Crook says he was inspired to attend film school by his experiences as a child actor in commercials. He appeared in ads for St. Joseph Aspirin and MasterCard, back when it was known as Master Charge. He says he’s still looking on YouTube to find the ads he filmed.</p>
<p>He attended San Francisco State University’s film program, leading him to connect with director Rob Nilsson, with whom he worked on films including “On the Edge,” “Heat and Sunlight” and “Chalk,” an indie classic involving a lazy yet gifted pool hustler who takes on a high-stakes contender after learning his stepfather has cancer. Crook also produced “Chalk,” which featured amateur actors from the Tenderloin Action Group, a actors’ workshop for the homeless in San Francisco.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Strawberry rec district plans for deficit to finance new playground</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-rec-district-plans-for-deficit-to-finance-new-playground</link>
     <description>The district aims to have the new playground complete by summer 2026.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Strawberry Recreation District is projecting a nearly $850,000 deficit this fiscal year, driven primarily by the cost of building a new playground at its East Strawberry Drive facility.</p>
<p>The district’s board of directors voted unanimously in May to approve the $4.32 million budget for fiscal 2025-2026, which began July 1. That’s against an anticipated $3.47 million in revenue, for a deficit of $848,372.</p>
<p>General Manager Nancy Shapiro said the deficit is planned, as the district knew it would have to dip into reserves to pay for the new play area. The playground is planned for the second floor of the facility outside the gym’s south entrance, to replace Reggie Park. That playground, located between the main building and tennis courts, was removed to make way for a new sport court for pickleball and basketball that opened in September 2024.</p>
<p>The playground cost is estimated at about $1 million, which Shapiro said is based on observing excavation costs to build the sport court and her conversations with playground companies. The district aims to have the new playground complete by summer 2026, though there’s currently no firm timeline for construction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Notes from an Appraiser: Playful skeleton imagery marks unique period in Japanese garment design</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/notes-from-an-appraiser-playful-skeleton-imagery-marks-unique-period-in-japanese-garment-design</link>
     <description>Most of the kimono designs featuring skulls seem to be a nod to the literary world. The skeletons, on the other hand, are humorous and playful, like those seen in the sketches of Japanese painter and caricaturist.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last two months I have been obsessed with Japanese skeleton kimonos. I was approached by a collector to appraise his 47-piece textile collection, all detailed in the scholarly essay “As We Are Now So Shall You One Day Be” by Jacqueline Atkins. Each of the kimonos has at least two photos, if not more, with commentary by Atkins discussing the motif or a link to an artist known for similar images. These kimonos are very rare and appeared on the Japanese market from 1920 to 1930, the Taishō period to the start of the Shōwa period. It was a time of world peace and exchange of ideas, architecture and modes of travel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>“The Art of Kathy Gray” is on display in at Tiburon Town Hall July 7-Aug. 27. An artist’s reception is planned for 6-8 p.m. July 8.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back when Kathy Gray was painting commissioned portraits, she started to think about ways to show prospective clients how true-to-life she could make her art look. She figured if people didn’t know the person she painted, they would not know if it was a good likeness, so she chose to paint a man almost everyone would recognize: Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>That portrait, which measures about 4 feet by 6 feet, greets visitors to a new Tiburon Town Hall exhibit of Gray’s work, “The Art of Kathy Gray,” on display in the upstairs gallery July 7-Aug. 27. An artist’s reception is planned for 6-8 p.m. July 8.</p>
<p>Among the other paintings on display in the show will be a portrait of Walt Disney. Gray says she happened to be thinking of all the joy Disney had brought to the world when she saw a photograph of the entrepreneur. In that photo, Disney is holding some papers, but Gray substituted Mickey Mouse in her painting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>New laws target gate hazards, throttle e-bikes for kids and distracted driving</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/new-laws-target-gate-hazards-throttle-e-bikes-for-kids-and-distracted-driving</link>
     <description>The local gate ordinance went into effect July 1 after being approved by the Town Council in May 2023.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new Tiburon rule now requires large gates to be outfitted with safeguards to prevent them from falling and potentially injuring or killing someone. The local ordinance joins a Marin-wide ban on throttle e-bikes for kids and a statewide ban on holding a phone while driving among new laws in place for the second half of 2025.</p>
<p>The local gate ordinance went into effect July 1 after being approved by the Town Council in May 2023. It requires property owners to ensure their vehicle and other automated and manual gates have posts that hold them upright if they become untethered from their tracks.</p>
<p>Any gate more than 48 inches wide or 84 inches tall must meet the standards and be designed, built and installed to:</p>
<p>Not fall over more than 45 degrees from a vertical plane when the gate is detached from supporting hardware.</p>
<p>Be balanced and not move under its own weight or by gravity.</p>
<p>Have covered rolling wheels, if applicable, to ensure they move smoothly.</p>
<p>Have positive stops to control the open and closed positions.</p>
<p>Gates must be inspected and certified at least once every five years.</p>
<p>The law was approved after urgings from former Greenbrae couple Eric and Dayna Quanbeck, whose 7-year-old son Alex was killed at Mark Day School in Terra Linda in December 2019 when a 450-pound metal rolling gate fell and hit him on the back of the head. Alex had tried to pull it shut during recess so the football that he and his classmates were tossing around would stay in the yard.</p>
<p>Tiburon Building Official Doug Haight said June 25 that the town has enforced the ordinance for all new gates, including requiring property owners undertaking remodels or having their home inspected to obtain a letter indicating their gate is certified.</p>
<p>“Part of what we’re going to be doing to try and gain compliance is try and educate people of their obligation under the ordinance,” he said.</p>
<p>Haight said there will be a reminder in an upcoming Tiburon Talk newsletter and that officials plan to send courtesy notices after they finish compiling a list of gates across town.</p>
<p>Enforcement will ultimately be determined in coordination with Town Manager Greg Chanis, who was on vacation and not available for comment by The Ark’s press deadline, Haight said, and whoever is hired as community development director to replace Dina Tasini, who left the role last month.</p>

     <title>Tiburon couple brings art, film to Marin County Fair</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-couple-brings-art-film-to-marin-county-fair</link>
     <description>In duo’s first exhibit together, recycled insect installation and a life-spanning short reflect decades of creative work.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A creative Tiburon couple — one a filmmaker and the other a sculptor — will each be featured at this year’sMarin County Fair, which runs July 2-6.</p>
<p>Cynthia Jensen, 77, widely known for her eco-inspired sculpture work, will display a series of insect sculptures made from recycled materials. Her husband, Harris Cohen, 88, whose decades-long film work includes editing Vietnam War footage for CBS and production for local station KPIX Channel 5, will show a short documentary at the fair. The exhibit coincides with this year’s fair theme, “Bug-Tastic.”</p>
<p>Cohen’s short film, “Passages: A Video Memoir,” shows at 6:15 p.m. July 3 at the Showcase Theater during the three-film Doc-Fest, part of the fair’s daily film festival. It traces his career as a videographer, producer and filmmaker. Originally created as a retrospective for his 87th birthday, Cohen said the film was intended for his grandchildren to understand more about his background.</p>
<p>Jensen’s artwork, which explores humankind’s impact on insect populations, will be displayed from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. July 2-6 in John MacLeod’s Virtual Reality booth in the fair’s exhibit hall. She said visitors can scan QR codes for information about various bugs. Her sculptures span more than 40 insects, including dragonflies, beetles, mosquitos and ladybugs. The display will also feature deep-sea exploration, including footage of the Cordell Bank off Point Reyes National Seashore, coral reefs and marine sanctuaries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon to hire designer for neighborhood park upgrades</title>

     <description>The work will focus on neighborhood miniparks at Cypress Hollow Park, Belveron Mini Park and the Bel Aire play area.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon plans to hire a landscape designer to explore updates for its neighborhood miniparks at Cypress Hollow Park, Belveron Mini Park and the Bel Aire play area, continuing the town’s directive to upgrade its parks.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously June 18 to approve a request for proposals to design the spaces. Community feedback for all parks indicated a need for greater maintenance and upkeep, with parks commissioners noting resident support for a new swing set for all children instead of the current toddler-only swings at Cypress Hollow Park, two to three benches at the Bel Aire space and removing flammable trees at Belveron Mini Park.</p>
<p>Public Works Engineering Manager David Eshoo said after the meeting that the timeline is in its early stages, but he hopes the Town Council can approve a design by September with Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission approval beforehand.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon officials are considering a public-art project featuring imitation street signs with positive messaging.</p>
<p>The Heritage and Arts Commission voted 4-1 June 18 to gather more information about Los Angeles artist Scott Froschauer’s proposal for “The Word on the Street” before recommending funding. Commissioner Nora Noguez dissented, and Commissioners Liz Feibusch and Azita de Mujica were absent.</p>
<p>If backed by the arts commission, the project would need approval from the Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission and the Town Council.</p>
<p>The signs wouldn’t be placed in “spaces that are dangerous to automobile traffic,” such as roadsides or locations that could appear to lead toward roads from a distance, Froschauer wrote in his proposal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Tiburon teens Charlie Scott and Nick Hartung were each awarded a $2,500 National Merit Scholarship.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon teens Charlie Scott and Nick Hartung were each awarded a $2,500 National Merit Scholarship, recognizing their academic accomplishments and leadership abilities, as well as their potential to succeed in a rigorous college program.</p>
<p>Charlie and Nick, who graduated from Redwood High School earlier this month, were among just three students in Marin County and 2,500 nationwide to be awarded the prestigious 2025 scholarship through National Merit’s own funds. Their honors were announced in May.</p>
<p>Some 1.5 million high-school juniors nationwide took the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test in October 2023 as an initial screening for the National Merit Scholar program, with 16,000 students advancing as semifinalists after they became seniors. Semifinalists were then required to write an essay and detail activities, awards and leadership roles, had to be endorsed by a high-school official and then earn SAT and ACT scores that confirmed their test performance. Some 15,000 students met the academic standards to become finalists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A pair of budding entrepreneurs squeeze out summer profits</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-pair-of-budding-entrepreneurs-squeeze-out-summer-profits</link>
     <description>Both say they’d consider professional sports if the lemonade industry turns sour.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sixth-grader Harry Hamilton says the amount of money he makes at his lemonade stand is a secret.</p>
<p>“It depends on the day,” he says. “It depends on how many walkers are out.”</p>
<p>Situated on the trail along Richardson Bay on June 18, Harry and his business partner, classmate Cole Peters, stand behind a white table blanketed with their merchandise: Hefty cups, clear pitchers of lemonade and a tray of cookies.</p>
<p>Harry says they’re popular due to the boys’ special recipe.</p>
<p>“It’s made from scratch. … Well, actually it’s from a package,” he says, though they add real lemons to make the juice “more lemony.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Bruce Charles Auld, 82, of Tiburon passed away peacefully at home on June 4, 2025.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bruce Charles Auld, 82, of Tiburon passed away peacefully at home on June 4, 2025. He is survived by his daughters, Ashley Auld-Fisher and Allie Auld-Hill; his grandchildren, Caroline Auld and William Auld-Hill; and his sister, Esther Ross. He is preceded in death by his beloved wife, Martha Auld, with whom he now rests in peace.</p>
<p>Born on February 13, 1943, in Seattle, Washington, Bruce lived a rich and full life defined by curiosity, craftsmanship, faith, and deep love for his family. Throughout his childhood, you would often find him sequestered in the basement of his family home building with erector sets, perfecting the knots he learned in Boy Scouts (and later Eagle Scouts), and teaching his niece and nephews (who lovingly called him “Uncle Chuck”) about math and science. Bruce also played football for the Queen Anne High School Grizzlies, and got into Columbia University on a track scholarship.</p>
<p>At Columbia, he earned his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, and his master’s in seismology. After school, he worked in geophysics and later started a small business providing field testing and analysis services. It was during this time that he met and fell in love with Martha. After a four-year courtship, they married on his birthday in 1977, and he built their forever home in the town of Tiburon, where they settled down to raise their family.</p>
<p>In his free time, he enjoyed tinkering with the latest (’80’s and ’90’s) computer technology, playing “King’s Quest” with his daughters, camping, fishing, playing the piano, and volunteering as a youth soccer coach. He was a gifted handyman that could fix nearly anything, insisting that no job was too big to tackle himself. He loved to garden, and enjoyed finding creative ways to transform his food surplus into meals and baked goods that he donated to the homeless. He has also served as a member of the vestry at St. Stephen’s Episcopal Church in Belvedere, where he dedicated his free time to keeping their services and computers running smoothly. He continued this work into his retirement, where he became an active Bridge player, opera goer, and crossword-puzzle addict. He also enjoyed relaxing with Martha on their back porch in Kauai, and fishing at Lake Powell.</p>
<p>His celebration of life memorial will be held at St. Stephen’s Episcopal Church in Belvedere/Tiburon on Aug 16, 2025, at 3:00 pm. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in support of the church he ...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon adopts $26 mil budget with focus on parks and open space</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-adopts-26-mil-budget-with-focus-on-parks-and-open-space</link>
     <description>At least $1.14 million is allocated for amenities and upgrades in fiscal 2025-2026.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon has adopted a $25.97-million budget that prioritizes its parks and open spaces, with at least $1.14 million allocated for amenities and upgrades in fiscal 2025-2026 and an additional $500,000 dedicated to its fund for future improvements.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously at its June 18 meeting to formally approve the budget, which showed no changes from the draft reviewed by the council earlier this month. The vote was part of the consent calendar, typically reserved for bulk approval of items deemed noncontroversial.</p>
<p>For fiscal 2025-2026, which begins July 1, the town is planning for $18.25 million in operating expenditures against $18.27 million in operating revenue, leaving a nearly $20,000 surplus. That doesn’t include the town’s $6.47 million capital-improvement program and $1.25 million in debt-services programs on equal revenue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>GreenTeam volunteers say someone&apos;s been stealing caterpillars and milkweed.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Tiburon Peninsula GreenTeam member Kathy McLeod arrived at the downtown butterfly garden earlier this month to check on milkweeds she had planted the day before, she discovered freshly cut stems where four plants had been growing.</p>
<p>“(The) stalks had been clipped, with fresh milkweed oozing from the stems,” she said. “Someone is stealing milkweed along with laid eggs and tiny caterpillars, the very thing that keeps the garden thriving.”</p>
<p>The four plundered plants, specifically showy milkweed, were part of the butterfly garden started by the nonprofit Tiburon Peninsula GreenTeam in 2021.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon Town Council divided in bike-lane letter to Caltrans</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/council-divided-in-bike-lane-letter-to-caltrans</link>
     <description>Tiburon officials want to see safety revisions in the first phase, and Caltrans is mulling its options.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon officials have asked Caltrans to address the impacts of planned Tiburon Boulevard bike lanes on safety, public transit, school buses and traffic, with an agency representative confirming June 23 that it was “coordinating with the town of Tiburon and discussing several options internally.”</p>
<p>The Town Council had voted 3-2 to send the 143-word letter, with Mayor Holli Thier and Councilmember Jack Ryan dissenting, afternearly three hoursof public comment and discussion June 18. Ryan wants the entire bike-lane segment between Blackfield Drive and Trestle Glen removed, while Thier said without further elaboration that the letter didn’t address all her safety concerns.</p>
<p>At a special June 4 forum with councilmembers, Southern Marin Supervisor Stephanie Moulton-Peters and residents, Caltrans had said the$12.7-million preventive-maintenance projectmust proceed as planned because of funding deadlines and concerns that winter storms could further damage the deteriorating roadway. The agency announced the project would come intwo phases, with the original plan as phase one.</p>
<p>In its presentation, the agency initially signaled it was open to revisions — phase one included “work with community and stakeholders,” next steps were to “update plans for phase one” and said “we want to hear from you” — but it became clear as the meeting progressed that any major revisions were planned for phase two.</p>
<p>The project as it stands</p>
<p>The yearlong first phase, to start in 2026, would repave the 4.6 miles of state-owned Highway 131 from Mill Valley city limits to Tiburon Boulevard’s intersection with Main Street, upgrading drainage systems, guardrails, curb ramps, signs, traffic signals, lighting, crosswalks and intersections. Officials also said the plan would now incorporate afiber-optic broadband conduitat Tiburon’s request and preserve medians that would have been eliminated.</p>
<p>For the bike lanes, a multiuse path would connect East Strawberry Drive to Greenwood Cove Drive, which serves as the current bike route to the Old Rail Trail. Otherwise, there would be separated and protected Class-4 bikeways west of Blackie’s Pasture to the south and west of Reed Ranch Road to the north. A one-block segment of standard Class-2 bike lanes would stretch from Reed Ranch to Jefferson Drive, connecting to an existing protected path to Trestle Glen Boulevard.</p>

     <media:description>Caltrans plans to add protected Class-4 bikeways for most of the Tiburon Boulevard project in 2026, though protected lanes were assessed and deemed &quot;infeasible&quot; for a segment between Reed Ranch Road and Jefferson Drive over infrastructure concerns and are curently planned as standard, unprotected Class-2 bike lanes under Caltrans implementation guidelines. However, Caltrans now says new the Class-2 lanes will be upgraded to Class-4 in the second phase of the project in 2027-2028. The lanes will connect to the existing path in the curve to Trestle Glen, which already sits off the road behind a guardrail. The Safe Routes to Schools path will remain on Greenwood Beach Drive.

     <description>Tiburon’s Audrey MacLean, 19, is first female runner between 10 and 33 to win the nation’s oldest trail race.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Audrey MacLean had long been obsessed with the Dipsea Race, the nation’s oldest trail race, since she first learned about it as a seventh grader.</p>
<p>She first ran the race in the summer before eighth grade, though she notes at the time she “wasn’t that good at running.”</p>
<p>That’s since changed. The Tiburon resident, now 19, was crowned the winner of the 114th Dipsea Race on June 8 with a time of 46 minutes, 28 seconds — 20 seconds ahead of runner-up Mark Tatum and 1 minute, 41 seconds ahead of third-place finisher and defending champion Chris Lundy. MacLean, who graduated from Redwood High School in 2023 and attended Reed Union School District schools, made history as the first female runner between the ages of 10 and 33 to win the race.</p>]]></content:encoded>
