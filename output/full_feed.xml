      <title>Couple sues Belvedere over $254K fine for delayed construction</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/couple-sues-belvedere-over-254k-fine-for-delayed-construction</link>
      <description>The claim says the penalty violated their constitutional rights of due process and against excessive fines.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Belvedere couple has filed a federal lawsuit against the city, challenging a nearly quarter-million-dollar fine imposed after their “dream home” renovation project exceeded the city’s construction time limit by more than eight months.</p>
<p>Laurent and Marguerite Lefouet filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on April 25, alleging the $254,400 penalty violated their constitutional rights of due process and against excessive fines. The couple claims city officials’ own delays in processing permit revisions caused much of the project’s tardiness, yet they were still penalized.</p>
<p>“(The Lefouets) worked diligently to complete the project. But their project was repeatedly delayed by Belvedere’s lack of diligence in reviewing and approving project goals, which ultimately led to a failure to complete the project within the arbitrarily short 18-month deadline,” the lawsuit states.</p>
<p>The suit comes as Belvedere is already litigating another suit filed in Marin Superior Court in October 2022 by Golden Gate Avenue resident David Flaherty. He was hit with a $300,000 construction time-limit penalty after his home-renovation project took more than 4½ years to complete. That alleges the city miscalculated extensions for the 2017 Tubbs fire and the COVID-19 pandemic, also while asserting Belvedere unconstitutionally failed to provide due process and assessed excessive fines.</p>
<p>“This is basically a windfall for the city of Belvedere,” the Lefouets’ attorney, Greg Walston of San Francisco-based Walston Law Group, said in an interview, calling the fines an illegal raising of revenue untethered from the city’s actual costs or harm. “They’re getting $300,000 out of Mr. Flaherty. They’re getting $254,000 out of Mr. Lefouet. This is just going to the city coffer and being used for whatever they want it to.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Officials warn Tiburon Boulevard bike-lane plan risks bus stops, traffic and safety</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/officials-warn-tiburon-boulevard-bike-lane-plan-risks-bus-stops-traffic-and-safety</link>
      <description>Caltrans’ 2026 project to rehabilitate and repave Tiburon Boulevard includes bike lanes that would eliminate four school-bus stops.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three local agencies say Caltrans’planned bike lanesalong Tiburon Boulevard will eliminate four school-bus stops, jam up traffic and endanger cyclists, adding to mounting criticism of the project’s design and communication process.</p>
<p>The Reed Union School District, Marin Transit and the Tiburon Peninsula Traffic Alliance have all submitted letters opposing aspects of the bike lanes planned between Blackfield Drive and Trestle Glen Boulevard.</p>
<p>In her April 15 letter, Reed district Superintendent Kimberly McGrath said the plan would “imperil bus transportation for a number of students and potentially encourage” them to bike what she calls “a busy transit corridor when a safer route is currently available to all bikes along Greenwood Beach Road.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <media:description>Cyclists ride down Greenwood Beach Road, parallel to Tiburon Boulevard, toward Blackie’s Pasture and the Old Rail Trail on May 4. Local officials say bike traffic is better suited to the street than out on Tiburon Boulevard, where as part of its 2026 project to rehabilitate and repave the road, Caltrans wants to create protected bike lanes on the north and south side of the road from Highway 101 to Trestle Glen Boulevard.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon police will conduct a special overnight DUI patrol operation from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. May 5.</p>
<p>"Impaired driving is preventable," Capt. Jarrod Yee said in a May 2 press release. "It's a choice. If you've been drinking or taken drugs that impair, make the right choice by finding a sober driver or alternate transportation to take you places."</p>
<p>The department said that impairment can come from sources beyond alcohol, including prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs and marijuana, which remains illegal to use while driving despite being legal for recreational and medicinal use in California.</p>
<p>First-time DUI offenders face an average of $13,500 in fines and penalties, plus license suspension, according to the release.</p>
<p>The enforcement effort is funded through a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety via the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Belvedere council OKs new fees to generate $594K more each year</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-council-oks-new-fees-to-generate-594k-more-each-year</link>
      <description>The higher service charges aim to better cover expenses and close growing budget gaps.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere will increase its building and planning fees beginning July 1, a move aimed at allowing the city to recover more costs from development projects and free up general-fund money for citywide initiatives.</p>
<p>The City Council voted unanimously at its April 14 meeting to adopt the new fee structure, which is expected to generate an additional $594,000 annually for the city. The council had previously signaled its intent to approve the new fees at its March meeting.</p>
<p>The increases are based on a study from consultant ClearSource Financial that found Belvedere currently recovers only 53% of costs for services like home remodels and other development projects. The city collects about $1.07 million annually in fee revenues but spends about $2.04 million providing these services, requiring it to pull nearly $968,000 from the general fund to cover the gap.</p>
<p>The new fee structure would immediately increase cost recovery to 82% with a target of reaching 91% in future years through annual inflationary adjustments. Building services would reach 100% cost recovery in the first year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Sticker shock pushes Bel Aire to rethink flood-control plans</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/sticker-shock-pushes-bel-aire-to-rethink-flood-control-plans</link>
      <description>The projected $1.1 million creek design is nearly three times what was anticipated.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Officials working on a flood-prevention project to restore two creeks in Tiburon’s Bel Aire neighborhood have ordered further studies after projected design and environmental-review costs for the work came back at $1.1 million — nearly three times what was anticipated.</p>
<p>The five-member Marin Flood Zone 4 advisory board voted 4-1 April 22, with member Carolyn Shadan dissenting, to direct West Sacramento-based firm CBEC, Inc. to spend $15,000-$20,000 to review information and literature surrounding hydrology and hydraulics at the East and West creeks in hopes of reducing the estimated design costs, which the board had budgeted at about $400,000 and which does not include the $2 million planned for constructing the project.</p>
<p>“It’s a very low-risk investment at this time that could get us closer to … the right direction in terms of overall project costs,” member Liza Gregory Bass said.</p>
<p>Judd Goodman, senior civil engineer with the water resources division at the Marin Public Works Department and the county’s staff liaison, said during the meeting that CBEC will be able to complete their assessment before the board’s next scheduled meeting in July.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>The block party will run 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. May 16, with lower Main Street closed to car traffic.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ranch will celebrate 50 years as Tiburon and Belvedere’s joint recreation agency with two free 1970s-themed events next month: a May 7 trivia night and a May 16 block party on lower Main Street.</p>
<p>The themed trivia night is set for 6:30 p.m. at the Tiburon Tavern, 1651 Tiburon Blvd., with gift cards as prizes. The block party will run 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. downtown, with lower Main Street closed to car traffic from 4 to 9 p.m. to accommodate set up and take down.</p>
<p>The block party will feature dance covers from Shake It Booty Band, a photo booth, games and prizes. There will be a slot machine to win free Ranch merchandise and a booth where attendees can make pet rocks, which were a fad in the 1970s. There will also be birthday cake. Residents can check out The Ranch’s social-media accounts in the days leading up to the celebrations to see old photos from the agency’s early days.</p>
<p>Ranch Executive Director Jessica Hotchkiss said the agency wanted to pay homage to the decade it formed while also creating an event for residents to come together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Owner of The Cove apartments defaults on $210 mil loan as its financial troubles grow</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/owner-of-the-cove-apartments-defaults-on-210-mil-loan-as-its-financial-troubles-grow</link>
      <description>The Tiburon Peninsula property is not Maximus Real Estate Partners’ only troubled asset.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The owners of The Cove at Tiburon, a 283-unit luxury apartment complex on Barbaree Road just outside Tiburon town limits, have reportedly defaulted on a $210 million loan, which could force a sale or foreclosure.</p>
<p>According to multiple Bay Area publications, bond rater Morningstar announced April 1 that San Francisco-based Maximus Real Estate Partners, headed by investor and wine collector Robert “Big Boy” Rosania, defaulted after the loan reached maturity in March.</p>
<p>The Ark could not independently verify the default with Morningstar after a spokesperson declined to comment, but the San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco Business Times and real-estate news outlet The Real Deal all cited Morningstar in reporting on the default. The Business Times also cited notes sent to bondholders.</p>
<p>It remains unclear what future control of the property looks like. Maximus did not respond to multiple emails seeking comment over the past two weeks. Cove complex management also did not respond to messages left by phone or during an impromptu in-person visit to its leasing office last week. One Cove employee said they were unaware of any default involving the complex.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tiburon resident wins silver in world tennis tournament</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-resident-wins-silver-in-world-tennis-tournament</link>
      <description>The former college standout has returned to form in 40-plus doubles.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly five years after she decided to spend more time getting back into competitive tennis, Tiburon resident Angela Lawrence-Hendy is making her mark on the international stage.</p>
<p>The 48-year-old was the runner-up alongside teammate Mariko Fritz-Krockow, 42, of Corte Madera in the 40-and-up women’s doubles event at the International Tennis Federation’s World Individual Championships, held March 15-22 in Manavgat, Turkey. She also captained the Australian 45-and-up women’s team at the Margaret Court Cup as part of the World Team Championships March 9-14 in Manavgat.</p>
<p>Winning the silver medal was amazing, Lawrence-Hendy says, as five years ago, she talked to her husband, James Hendy, about competing in more tennis tournaments and what it would take to get to that level.</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘You know, I’m not really done competing,’” Lawrence-Hendy recalls. “I’d like to see if I can try and make top 50 in the world.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strawberry resident Suzanne Brooks says she’s enjoying a calm pace of life as she walks Bennie, her 2-year-old Australian labradoodle, along the San Francisco Bay Trail and Greenwood Cove Road April 22. She gives Bennie a treat as they walk, and he leaps to eat it.</p>
<p>Brooks, who currently works part-time managing properties in Marin and Sonoma counties and has recently taken up watercolor classes offered at the College of Marin, spent 33 years working in pharmaceutical sales, mostly in ophthalmology, before retiring in 2021.</p>
<p>“I was more satisfied than I ever thought I would be, honestly,” she says.</p>
<p>While she planned on being a bench researcher when entering college, that changed when Brooks waited tables while doing research.</p>
<p>“I liked waiting tables better than I liked doing the research,” Brooks says. “So that really told me how much of a people person that I am.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/owner-cinelounge-won-t-close-this-week-despite-fundraising-urgency</link>
      <description>Email campaign was a ‘Hail Mary’ to generate support for the transition to a nonprofit.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon resident Christian Meoli says his downtown movie theater won’t close this week, despite a fundraising campaign that suggested Cinelounge needed to raise $500,000 by April 21 to survive.</p>
<p>Meoli, who co-owns the theater with his wife Camilla, acknowledged the messaging was a deliberate “Hail Mary” approach after earlier announcements about the theater’s planned transition to nonprofit status failed to gain traction.</p>
<p>“That’s the decision that I had to make to really jumpstart what we consider to be, so far, a very successful initiative,” Meoli said in an April 16 phone interview.</p>
<p>The theater’s GoFundMe campaign, titled “Preserve a Community Cinema Born from Love,” warned in an April 14 email that “our beloved Cinelounge could fade to black for good” without reaching its financial goal. But Meoli clarified that people could continue donating after the deadline, adding that meeting even part of the goal would provide a good start over the next couple of months toward resolving the theater’s financial struggles.</p>
<p>The theater will hold a “Save the Reels, Raise the Roof” fundraiser from 5:30 to 9 p.m. April 29 at Malibu Farm, whose co-owner John Stockwell was Cougar in 1986’s “Top Gun” and directed 2002’s “Blue Crush.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tiburon Councilmember Nikfar misses yet another state financial report deadline</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-councilmember-nikfar-misses-yet-another-state-financial-report-deadline</link>
      <description>The failure to file reflects a pattern for Nikfar, who missed three disclosure deadlines August 2023 and November 2024 elections.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four Tiburon Town Council­members have disclosed economic interests totaling at least $2.84 million for 2024, while Councilmember Isaac Nikfar has once again failed to submit legally required financial reports by the state deadline.</p>
<p>Councilmember Jack Ryan leads with a minimum of $1.17 million in economic interests, followed by Mayor Holli Thier with at least $1 million. Councilmember Alice Fredericks reported at least $453,013, while Vice Mayor Jon Welner disclosed at least $210,001.</p>
<p>California law requires these annual economic-interest statements, known as Form 700, to be filed by April 1. The California Fair Political Practices Commission mandates that all elected officials and public employees “who (make) or (influence) governmental decisions” submit these disclosures.</p>
<p>The failure to file state-mandated financial disclosures for his office reflects a pattern for Nikfar, who missed two deadlines for campaign-finance disclosures related to the November 2024 election, most recently a semiannual report due Jan. 31. Nikfar also missed his initial campaign-finance disclosure requirement in July 2023 before a special election that August, when he was first voted into office. Nikfar has declined to comment on any of the campaign-finance reporting lapses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>School foundation saddling up for rodeo fundraiser</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/school-foundation-saddling-up-for-rodeo-fundraiser</link>
      <description>The May 10 event for the Reed Union district will feature dinner, dancing and a live auction.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Foundation for Reed Schools is asking parents to don their “boots and bling” for the May 10Reed Rodeo, a Western-themed night of dinner and dancing to help raise money for enrichment classes at the Reed Union School District’s three schools.</p>
<p>The event, set for 6 p.m. at Peacock Gap Golf Club in San Rafael, serves as the foundation’s final big push to meet its $2-million fundraising goal for the 2024-2025 school year, with most of that money going directly to the district to help support art, music, physical education, language and library programs.</p>
<p>Jen Feldman, the foundation’s director of marketing, communications and events, called the annual gala “a great way to bring the community together.”</p>
<p>“This is a way for parents to come together and to help raise money and to really instill what the foundation does into the parents that attend,” she said.</p>
<p>This year’s fundraising efforts also include an online auction, which runs May 1-11 and is open to both district families and the larger community. It will feature a variety of items available for bid, including grade-level hikes for parents, yoga classes, a gift card to Sam’s Anchor Cafe and a bay boat cruise for dads.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Sani 5 OKs $3-mil rehab of aging Cove Road pump station</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/sani-5-oks-3-mil-rehab-of-aging-cove-road-pump-station</link>
      <description>Construction is targeted for spring 2026 because it will take up to a year to obtain one of the necessary parts for the upgrade.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sanitary District No. 5 of Marin will spend $3.3 million to rehabilitate its Cove Road pump station, with work set to begin in spring 2026.</p>
<p>The district board of directors unanimously approved separate contracts at its April 17 meeting: $2.84 million with Fort Bragg-based Fort Bragg Electric for the construction and $168,889 with San Rafael-based Nute Engineering for construction management. Both contracts include a 10% contingency. Funding will come from the district’s capital reserves, District Manager Tony Rubio said.</p>
<p>Construction is targeted for spring 2026 because it will take up to a year to obtain one of the necessary parts for the upgrade, the motor-control center, estimated to cost $628,000, he said.</p>
<p>The actual work to rehabilitate the station, located at the corner of Cove and Barn roads in Belvedere, will last three to four months.</p>
<p>Nute Engineering, which also designed the project, found that the station’s electrical switchgear and motor-control center exhibited “age-related conditions, which include difficulty in finding replacement parts.” The station was built in 1961 and reconfigured in 1981 to include dry- and wet-weather pumps for respective flows.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Angel Island exhibit looks at border surveillance technology</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/angel-island-exhibit-looks-at-border-surveillance-technology</link>
      <description>“Border Surveillance: Places, People and Technology” features panels detailing technologies used to monitor border crossings — from aerostats and drones to fixed cameras and ground sensors.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Visitors to the Angel Island Immigration Museum can explore a new temporary exhibit examining border-surveillance technologythrough May 25, thanks to a collaboration with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>
<p>“Border Surveillance: Places, People and Technology,” which opened April 2 at the museum on Angel Island State Park in Tiburon, features panels detailing technologies used to monitor border crossings — from aerostats and drones to fixed cameras and ground sensors. The exhibit also explores emerging surveillance methods, including augmented reality and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Edward Tepporn, executive director of the Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation that oversees the museum, said that while the digital-privacy nonprofit developed the exhibit independently, he was proud the museum serves as its inaugural venue.</p>
<p>“Part of the interest in hosting it is that the work that we’ve done at the foundation, in collaboration with Angel Island State Park, over the past 40-plus years has been about lifting up the history of immigration through Angel Island, but also how it connects to current-day immigration,” Tepporn said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Aubrey O’Connor is the new Reed Elementary School principal, replacing Mary Niesyn, who is retiring.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A longtime teacher and administrator in the Mill Valley School District has been named the next principal at Reed Elementary School.</p>
<p>Aubrey O’Connor, the current principal at Park Elementary School, will join the Reed Union School District July 1, with a starting annual salary of $200,000. Her hiring was approved by a 4-0 vote of the district board at its April 15 meeting; the item was included in the district’s personnel report as part of the board’s consent agenda, reserved for bulk approval of items deemed noncontroversial. Board member Afsaneh Zolfaghari was absent.</p>
<p>O’Connor was chosen among seven applicants interviewed to replace Mary Niesyn, who is retiring after a 21-year career at the school that saw her serve as a second-grade teacher and assistant principal before assuming the top job in 2015.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mark Marsella stands beside his 3-year-old daughter Giani, watching as son Troy steps up to bat for the Tiburon Peninsula Little League’s Yankees during an afternoon game against the Diamondbacks April 15 at the Strawberry Recreation District field.</p>
<p>As Troy, 11, makes it to first base, Marsella smiles with satisfaction. The Tiburon Peninsula Little League president says Giani often accompanies him to games and is learning about baseball through observation. He plans to involve her in softball when she’s old enough.</p>
<p>“It’s fun,” Marsella, 43, says about Little League. “They play because they love it. The best part is seeing all the kids have a great time.”</p>
<p>Marsella says he appreciates the parental involvement in the league.</p>
<p>“A lot of people are focused on the kids and making sure they’re learning, growing and enjoying themselves,” he says.</p>]]></content:encoded>
