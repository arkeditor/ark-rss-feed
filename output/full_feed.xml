     <description>al real estate analyst&apos;s 2010 painting class gift from wife leads to debut solo show.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his late 30s, commercial real-estate analyst Brian Higgins received an unexpected Christmas gift from his wife: A painting class.</p>
<p>Higgins had long worked with what he calls his “analytical” mind, first earning a law degree from the University of California College of the Law at San Francisco, then called UC Hastings, in the 1990s, then building a career in commercial real estate. The introduction to painting class, he says, awakened something he’d lost long ago.</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, the Belvedere resident has landed his first solo art exhibition. “Ascend: The Evolution of Identity” will be held Sept. 30-Oct. 11 at the Alessandro Berni Gallery in New York City. Beyond a collection of his impressionism-meets-abstraction paintings, the exhibition will also feature a live painting performance, during which Higgins will create a full piece before an audience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Zand says her life is a balance of two sides of her mind: the practical, analytical side that grounds her work as a pharmacist at the Tiburon Boulevard CVS/pharmacy — her “medicine side” she says — and the holistic, intuition-based side that inspires her passion for sound-bath healing by night — “my more witchy side.”</p>
<p>“I tap into both sides,” she says. “I think they are both healing in different ways.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Margaret Rose Sloan Peterson</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/margaret-rose-sloan-peterson</link>
     <description>Margaret Rose Sloan Peterson of Tiburon died July 29, 2025, at age 87.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Margaret Rose Sloan Peterson was born on March 31, 1938, in Ilford, Essex, England. The family relocated to Liverpool during World War II after her father, James Sloan, passed away from pneumonia. Margaret grew up in a loving and supportive household with her mother, Doris Moss Sloan; her aunts Margaret, Eva, and Florence; her brother, John Dennis Leslie; and sister, Catherine Elizabeth. Extended family and cousins lived nearby, and she formed lifelong friendships with the McDonald sisters, Isabel, Pamela, and Christine, who became like family to her and they remained very close throughout her life.</p>
<p>In 1963, Margaret’s adventurous spirit brought her to San Francisco. She embraced the scene and remained in the San Francisco Bay Area for the rest of her life. She met her husband, James Francis Peterson of San Francisco, and they married in England before settling in Tiburon.</p>
<p>Together they had two children. After they divorced in 1974, Margaret remained in Tiburon, cherishing its views, community, and natural beauty. She enjoyed traveling, films, reading, classical music, positive vibes, and wildflower walks on the hilltops. Always friendly, positive, and curious, she loved chatting with neighbors, passersby, and striking up friendly exchanges with people during her travels.</p>
<p>Margaret made personal connections with everyone and cultivated friendships across generations and continents, staying in touch through heartfelt letters and cards, always timing birthday cards to arrive precisely on the day.</p>
<p>Professionally, Margaret was instrumental at the Tiburon Belvedere Childcare Center, housed in the old Tiburon Elementary School. Afterwards, she was a legal secretary, taking the ferry and knitting many sweaters and baby gifts while she commuted to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Margaret was Mother Earth personified. She lived with minimal impact and was an ardent environmentalist, advocating for sustainability and conservation long before it was mainstream. As her last earthly gesture, she donated her body to the Stanford Anatomical Gift Program.</p>
<p>Margaret passed away peacefully in her home, surrounded by love, on July 29, 2025. She was 87 years old. Her gentle kindness and many loving connections will be remembered always.</p>
<p>She is survived by her children, Timothy James (Delia Marie) and Kristina Catherine (David Thompson); grandchildren Fiona Bridget, Riley Sloan, Kevin James, Caitlin Rose, Christine Kelly, and Dexter James Sloan...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert (Bob) Bernheim, a devoted family man, passionate sailor, and community leader, was born in San Francisco on September 26, 1933. He grew up in the city, spending cherished summers at his parents’ home on Corinthian Island, where his love for the sea first took root.</p>
<p>Bob earned dual degrees in business and engineering from UC Berkeley and proudly served as a captain in the Army Corps of Engineers in the late 1950s. Following his service, he took the helm of Coast Counties Property Management, a company founded by his father, Jules, and later joined by his son, Brad, continuing the family legacy.</p>
<p>Deeply committed to his community, Bob served as a member and president of BOMA, the Building Owners and Managers Association, as well as a member of the Belvedere Planning Commission and the Rotary Club.</p>
<p>A lover of life both on land and water, Bob’s passion for the sea was infectious. His motto: “Feeling sick? Get out on the water. Feeling blue? Go sailing. Broken arm? Water’s the cure,” was a guiding principle throughout his life, even into his final months.</p>
<p>Bob was an active member of the St. Francis Yacht Club, the San Francisco Yacht Club, and the Cruising Club of America. In the early 1950s, he joined the International 210 fleet with his boat, Top Banana, winning numerous races. Over the years, he competed in Bay Area classics, the Transpac, and voyages to Mexico. His fleet of boats included a Moon boat, a Clipper, a Rhodes 33, and, later, powerboats such as a Trojan, Grand Banks, and Grand Alaskan. In his later years, he found joy in watching junior sailors and gazing out at the bay from his home on Corinthian Island.</p>
<p>Bob’s adventurous spirit extended beyond sailing. He traveled extensively with his family, exploring new places across the U.S. and abroad. A lover of the arts, he was passionate about theater and never missed a performance at SF Broadway, enjoying everything from classical musicals to Green Day.</p>
<p>He also had a sweet tooth, delighting in pie, cookies, ice cream, and especially See’s Candy. Marin Joe’s, his favorite local restaurant, was a frequent gathering spot for him and his loved ones.</p>
<p>Holidays and time with family brought Bob immense joy. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Susan, and his stepson, Walter Finch. He is survived by his son, Brad (Cynthia); daughter, Brenda “BB” (Carl Straub); stepdaughter, Susie Finch (Sandra Cook); daughter-in-law, Lauren Finch; grandson, Nich...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Ex-mayor pitches pedestrian tunnel to trail near Del Mar</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/ex-mayor-pitches-pedestrian-tunnel-to-trail-near-del-mar</link>
     <description>&quot;Light bulb moment&quot; envisions 22-foot connection between neighborhoods and Old Rail Trail, but councilmembers want traffic reduction first.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former Tiburon mayor is pitching a new idea he says could reduce traffic congestion and increase safety along Tiburon Boulevard: a pedestrian and bike tunnel that would run underneath the road and connect the Old Rail Trail to the Del Mar Middle School tennis courts, where it would then meet an existing pedestrian path that leads to the Reed Heights-Tiburon Knolls and Del Mar neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Andrew Thompson said he has spent about seven months talking about the idea with neighbors, town staff and Reed Union School District officials, as well as a tunnel-construction company headed by a Tiburon resident, though he declined to name the company.</p>
<p>For now, the idea is just that — a suggestion, both Thompson and Town Manager Greg Chanis said, with Chanis noting the town is treating the idea like all resident-submitted traffic ideas, including forwarding it to Parametrix, a consultant working on a traffic study of Tiburon Boulevard, Paradise Drive and Trestle Glen Boulevard. A draft of the study is expected to be presented to the Town Council in November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Dead coyote in Belvedere likely pup of mated pair, expert says</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/dead-coyote-in-belvedere-likely-pup-of-mated-pair-expert-says</link>
     <description>Second coyote death in a year raises questions about poisoning, while experts say lethal control methods don&apos;t work anyway.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A coyote found dead in a Golden Gate Avenue driveway Aug. 22 was likely a 5-month-old pup of Belvedere’s resident mated pair, according to the city’s wildlife expert.</p>
<p>Despite initial concerns the pup may have been poisoned or killed on purpose, consultant Rebecca Dmytryk ofHumane Wildlife Controlsaid there were no obvious signs of poisoning, though a toxicology test is pending.</p>
<p>A resident reported the coyote to the Belvedere Police Department after spotting the animal about 6 feet down from the top of their driveway. Marin Humane was called to document the incident and remove the animal carcass.</p>
<p>It was the second such coyote death reported in less than a year, as a male coyote carcass was discovered by a resident on Belvedere Way in October. In that case, California Department of Fish and Wildlife toxicology tests determined the animal had likely died after ingesting antifreeze, while it also tested positive for six rodenticides, five of which were anticoagulant compounds that caused mild but nonlethal hemorrhaging.</p>
<p>It was unclear if the coyote had been exposed to the substances accidentally or intentionally amid an ongoing debate among residents about how to best deal with coyotes on the peninsula.</p>
<p>Animals can ingest anticoagulant rodenticides either by directly consuming bait, by eating rodents that have ingested the poison or by eating those rodents’ predators.</p>
<p>Local coyote family is two adults, four to five pups</p>
<p>Dmytryk said she could not comment definitively on the cause of death for the pup found Aug. 22, but she noted photographs showed that the animal’s body was not exhibiting some of the telltale signs of poisoning, including straight, stiff legs.</p>
<p>She said the results of the toxicology tests will likely take several weeks.</p>
<p>The pup was one of a litter born about five months ago to the resident male and female pair, Dmytryk said. She said she’s unsure about the exact number of pups but that Marin Humane believes it to be four or five.</p>
<p>The male adult coyote that died in October had been the mate of the resident female. Those two animals had a litter of five pups that remained on the peninsula while young but have since dispersed to other areas, Dmytryk said. The female then took on a new partner, and their current litter will follow the same pattern, she said. They’ll explore the peninsula and most will likely disperse to wider areas in the coming months, with the exception of o...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Ex-official sues Tiburon over alleged pregnancy harassment</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/ex-official-sues-tiburon-over-alleged-pregnancy-harassment</link>
     <description>Fired town official claims colleagues mocked &quot;pregnant belly and pregnant ass&quot; while manager refused to intervene.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon’s former director of administrative services is suing the town, alleging she was harassed by two of her colleagues throughout her pregnancy and upon her return from maternity leave. She also alleges top officials, including the town manager, not only failed to stop the behavior but retaliated against her when she reported it.</p>
<p>In the complaint, which was filed in Sonoma Superior Court and is currently being transferred to Marin Superior Court, Suzanne Creekmore accuses Finance Manager Troy Bassett and former Director of Community Development Dina Tasini of making disparaging remarks about her pregnancy, which she disclosed in summer 2022.</p>
<p>Bassett, who reported directly to Creekmore, allegedly called a pregnant woman’s stomach a “horrible belly” and said she was “‘pissed’ about (Creekmore’s) planned maternity leave because her temporary absence would impact (Bassett’s) ‘lifestyle,’” while Tasini reportedly mocked Creekmore’s appearance, including saying she had a “pregnant belly, and a pregnant ass!” in front of colleagues and telling Creekmore in private to “get a different job” because Creekmore “would no longer be able to perform her duties as director once her baby was born.”</p>
<p>Creekmore's claim states she was fired in April 2024. All those named in the suit declined to comment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere’s first lot-split property hits the market</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-s-first-lot-split-property-hits-the-market</link>
     <description>The city is counting on the 2022 law to help meet its 2031 housing mandate.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first new Belvedere home created under California’s lot-splitting law has hit the market.</p>
<p>Resident Christina Wang of 421 Golden Gate Ave. successfully broke off about 40% of her 22,783-square-foot parcel under 2022’s Senate Bill 9. She listed the new address, 419 Golden Gate Ave., for $4.25 million in April. The new 9,113-square-foot lot — on the southern ridge of Belvedere Island with views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Richardson Bay and Sausalito to the east and Belvedere Cove and Tiburon to the west — contains a two-bedroom, 925-square-foot residence that previously served as the larger property’s guest house.</p>
<p>It also creates one new market-rate unit in Belvedere’s housing inventory.</p>
<p>The city must add 160 new units in the state’s 2023-2031 housing cycle, and lot splits play a key role in Belvedere’s planning roadmap, projecting 27 of those units will be created under the new law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Trip hazards prompt Belvedere to flatten six mounds at playground</title>

     <description>Parks officials will study liability issues and removal of the other six.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere will remove six rubber mounds from Community Park’s playground after city officials determined they pose tripping hazards to children and families using the facility.</p>
<p>The city plans to flatten the tan-colored mounds at the edge of the playground’s tanbark area and blend them into the surrounding rubberized surface. Associate Engineer Chris Barry told the Parks, Open Spaces and Lanes Committee Aug. 21 that these mounds present “more of a tripping hazard” because their coloring blends with the tanbark, making them hard to see.</p>
<p>Barry said the city expects the removal project to cost $7,000 to $10,000, with work expected to begin in mid to late September.</p>
<p>However, there are six more blue-colored mounds, and committee members said they want all 12 removed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Heritage and Arts Commission voted 6-0 Aug. 26, with Commissioner Jaleh Etemad absent, to keep working with artist Scott Froschauer to refine his “The Word on the Street” proposal, aiming to review it again Sept. 23.</p>
<p>Froschauer creates vandalism-resistant signs built to U.S. Transportation Department standards but replaces the typical commands with affirmations.</p>
<p>After discussing Froschauer’s proposal at its June and July meetings, the arts board asked the artist to come back with more specific details about the signs. The most recent plans from Froschauer, who visited Tiburon Aug. 20 and met with commission Chair Arjun Gupta, call for 15 signs, which would cost a total of $20,000: $1,000 per sign and a $5,000 start-up fee. He reduced the exhibition period from one year to six months, proposing signs at Zelinsky Park, Cypress Hollow Park, Teather Park and South of the Knoll Park.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nicholas Schoichet has turned his passion for board games into a community-building mission across Marin County.</p>
<p>“Get in here, lose a game, look like a fool, have fun,” says the 35-year-old Tiburon resident, one of the leading figures of Marin Board Games, a community group that meets for gaming nights at least twice a month in Terra Linda.</p>
<p>Schoichet, who also runs a monthly board-game design group at the Starbucks in the Strawberry Village shopping center, says he loves a high-quality board game — whether it can be taught in five minutes or is more nuanced and “gives you a perspective on something that you were not thinking about.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tiburon couple isselling yellow bowsto raise money for osteosarcoma research in honor of their late teenage daughter, who died of the rare bone cancer five years ago.</p>
<p>Greg and Sarah Kaplan will sell the bows throughout September to mark Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, with proceeds going toward MIB Agents, a nonprofit focused on improving pediatric osteosarcoma research, education and medical care. The Kaplans’ only child, Sydney, died of the cancer in 2020 at age 15 after being diagnosed two years earlier.</p>
<p>The $25 bows can be mailed out, but for those who live locally, the Kaplans can assemble, deliver and install the bow on a donor’s property. Several of the homes near the Kaplans sport bows from past years’ fundraising efforts; Sarah Kaplan says she and her husband raised $2,300 for osteosarcoma research in 2024 and $3,000 in 2023; the couple has fundraised for osteosarcoma-related support and research efforts every September since Sydney’s death.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Belvedere completes $113,000 Park Lane staircase, but residents criticize concrete bench&apos;s &quot;brutalist&quot; design.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere has completed a concrete staircase along Park Lane, though the project’s concrete bench is drawing criticism for its “brutalist” design and unclear function.</p>
<p>The city’s Parks, Open Spaces and Lanes Committee heard concerns about the bench at its special meeting Aug. 21. The Park Lane staircase, completed about Aug. 15, includes a metal railing and the new bench midway up.</p>
<p>The estimated cost was $113,035, using $38,623 from the city’s general fund, $36,412 from the Transportation Authority of Marin through revenue generated by Measure B — a vehicle-registration fee increase passed by voters in 2010 — and a $38,000 grant from the Belvedere Community Foundation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere&apos;s Sal Bonavita was one of the earliest owners of Peet’s Coffee</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-s-sal-bonavita-was-one-of-the-earliest-owners-of-peet-s-coffee</link>
     <description>Sal Bonavita, Alfred Peet&apos;s hand-picked successor who owned Peet&apos;s Coffee in the 1980s, died at 84 in Belvedere.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere resident Sal Bonavita, a businessman whose career as a coffee and tea importer led him to become Alfred Peet’s hand-picked successor at Peet’s Coffee, died at his home July 28 following complications related to dementia. He was 84.</p>
<p>Bonavita owned the coffee company through the mid-1980s after purchasing it from company namesake Alfred Peet in 1979. The New York Times called Peet the “leader of a coffee revolution” in his 2007 obituary. Peet founded the coffee shop in Berkeley in 1966 and continued to work alongside Bonavita as a consultant on maintaining his high standards for coffee and tea after selling the company.</p>
<p>Before acquiring Peet’s, Bonavita had built his career as an importer by the end of the 1970. He sold specialty teas and coffees, Italian espresso machines and other accessories to luxury department stores across the U.S.</p>
<p>After selling Peet’s to Starbucks co-founder Jerry Baldwin in 1984, Bonavita continued to consult for coffee roasters, such as Sonoma County-based Wolf Coffee Co. He also had his own coffee venture, the now-closed Bonavita Coffee and Tea Co. in Mill Valley.</p>
<p>Healdsburg residents and Wolf Coffee founders Richard and Jeanne Mariani said Bonavita was a mentor to them when they founded their coffee company in 1990 on both roasting and operating fronts.</p>
<p>“He provided just this attention to quality and attention to detail in every step of the process,” Jeanne Mariani said.</p>
<p>John Weaver was hired by Bonavita to work at Peet’s Coffee in 1980 and later became its master roaster. He left in 2007 to start San Rafael-based Weaver’s Coffee and Tea.</p>
<p>Weaver said Bonavita became “one of the best experts in the world” because Peet mentored him. Weaver includes his coffee-making heritage, featuring Peet and Bonavita, on his coffee-bean bags and roasts one blend using the same 1905 model of roaster Peet used as an homage to the two.</p>
<p>“I didn’t realize how special, till later, that what I was being taught was,” Weaver said, calling Bonavita a “legendary” figure.</p>
<p>Early life and family</p>
<p>Salvatore Alexander Bonavita was born Jan. 6, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York, to Anthony Bonavita and Rita Limoncelli. Raised in Brooklyn, he was the couple’s only child and the grandson of Italian immigrants.</p>
<p>He was married twice. First to Odette Sarkis, whom he met when he picked up her older brother and his college roommate. The couple moved to the Tiburon Peninsula in 1975, where...</p>]]></content:encoded>
