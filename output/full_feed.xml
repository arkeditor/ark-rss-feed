     <title>Belvedere funnels $1M into seawall, other city projects</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-funnels-1m-into-seawall-other-city-projects</link>
     <description>The additional work incldues police facility upgrades, storm-drain assessments and a shoreline cleanup.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere will allocate $1.03 million from an unexpected budget surplus to shore up Beach Road’s crumbling seawall and fund police facility upgrades, storm-drain assessments and a shoreline cleanup.</p>
<p>The City Council voted unanimously Jan. 12 to allocate the funds, with $830,000 going to the seawall and $200,000 split among the other projects, on the recommendation of the city’s Finance Committee.</p>
<p>The allocation follows fiscal 2024-2025, which ended June 30, 2025, when revenues exceeded projections by $1.76 million — a windfall that created $1.38 million in excess reserves after meeting the city’s reserve requirements. The remaining $350,000 stays in the general fund as a financial buffer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere honors pandemic leaders as Citizen of the Year, Emeritus</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-honors-pandemic-leaders-as-citizen-of-the-year-emeritus</link>
     <description>The city will honor Nancy Kemnitzer and Pam Martori at its 46th annual town hall meeting Jan. 27.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the coronavirus pandemic hit in March 2020, Nancy Kemnitzer was nine months into her term as Belvedere’s mayor, grappling with how to keep residents safe through the crisis. That same month, Pam Martori stood in an empty church hall packing brown-bag lunches for people whose meal programs had vanished overnight.</p>
<p>Nearly six years later, the city will honor both Jan. 27 for their pandemic-era service and decades of community contributions. Kemnitzer has been named Belvedere’s 2025 Citizen of the Year. Martori received the Citizen Emeritus honor.</p>
<p>Kemnitzer served a decade on the Planning Commission before her 2016 move to the City Council. She served eight years on the council, including 1½ years as mayor from July 2019 to December 2020. She has also volunteered as a neighborhood block captain.</p>
<p>“Her actions define volunteerism for the selfless betterment of the community,” said Peyton Stein, chair of the Citizen of the Year Committee, which is made up of past honorees and makes the annual selection.</p>
<p>Martori has made her mark through a different kind of service. Under her leadership, volunteers assemble more than 100 sandwich lunches each week for the St. Vincent de Paul Free Dining Room in San Rafael and for residents of The Hilarita apartments in Tiburon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Half of Marin’s 10 most expensive home sales in 2025 were on Tiburon Peninsula</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/half-of-marin-s-10-most-expensive-home-sales-in-2025-were-on-tiburon-peninsula</link>
     <description>Billionaire designer Jony Ive’s $43.5-million purchase of the Locksley Hall mansion in Belvedere was No. 1.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Peninsula claimed half of Marin’s 10 most-expensive home sales in 2025, led by billionaire designer Jony Ive’s $43.5-million purchase of the Locksley Hall mansion in Belvedere — the priciest single-family-home transaction in the county last year and more than $20 million higher than the second most-expensive sale.</p>
<p>Ive bought the three-story, 9,235-square-foot home at 440 Golden Gate Ave., better known locally as the Blanding House, on Aug. 28. The purchase was the county’s largest residential sale since the historic property was last sold for $47.5 million in 2015, some $25.6 million higher than the second-ranked 2025 sale of $17.9-million for a home at 174 Seadrift Road in Stinson Beach.</p>
<p>The Blanding House was part of a four-home, $73-million off-market package that also included the Organ House at 433 Golden Gate Ave., which sold for $14.62 million and ranked sixth in the county; 432 Golden Gate Ave., which sold for $6.9 million; and 330 Beach Road, which sits below the homes on Belvedere Cove and sold for $7.98 million.</p>
<p>Beyond Ive’s purchases, the peninsula’s top 10 sales included 34 Eucalyptus Road in Belvedere, which ranked fourth at $15 million; 8 Eucalyptus Road in Belvedere, which ranked 10th at $13 million; and 275 Diviso St. in Tiburon, which ranked eighth at $13.22 million.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon parents to be honored for decades of cystic fibrosis advocacy</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-parents-to-be-honored-for-decades-of-cystic-fibrosis-advocacy</link>
     <description>Tiburon residents Michael and Bonnie Rose are receiving the 2026 Breath of Life Award from the Northern California chapter of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation during its gala Feb. 28 in San Francisco. The Roses are longtime supporters of the foundation, with efforts bolstered following their daughter Katie’s diagnosis with the disease in 2001. (via Bonnie Rose) After Bonnie and Michael Rose welcomed their third child, Katie, in 2001, they knew “something was off right away,” Bonnie says.  ...</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Bonnie and Michael Rose welcomed their third child, Katie, in 2001, they knew “something was off right away,” Bonnie says.</p>
<p>Katie wasn’t gaining weight and was experiencing stomach aches — symptoms her older sisters, Chelsea and Kayla, didn’t have as newborns.</p>
<p>At just eight weeks old, Katie was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, pancreas and other organs. Both Bonnie and her husband carry the gene that causes cystic fibrosis, but they didn’t know it at the time.</p>
<p>“We just all of a sudden realized that this third kid, which was supposed to be easy because we know how to do this, we didn’t know how to do any of this,” Bonnie says. “And we were going to need help.”</p>
<p>The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a nonprofit that aims to cure the disease while funding research and drug development and advancing specialized care for those living with the disorder, became a major resource for the Tiburon family. The Roses, in turn, became dedicated to the organization, with Bonnie, the principal adviser and owner of Rose College Strategies, organizing and chairing various foundation-related galas and Michael financially supporting the foundation through his dry-cleaning company, Vogue Cleaners on Tiburon Boulevard.</p>
<p>On Feb. 28, the couple will be honored with the Breath of Life Award at the Breath of Life Gala, hosted by the foundation’s Northern California chapter at the Westin St. Francis in San Francisco.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>New Belvedere police officer brings Mill Valley experience to smaller force</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/new-belvedere-police-officer-brings-mill-valley-experience-to-smaller-force</link>
     <description>Preston’s hire brings some long-awaited relief to the Belvedere department, which had been operating with only four officers.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After spending just over two years as an officer with the Mill Valley Police Department, Tyler Preston was ready for a change — and he says he’s found it in Belvedere.</p>
<p>“Mill Valley is a lot busier than Belvedere so far,” says Preston, who joined the city’s Police Department as a patrol officer Jan. 4 and was ceremonially sworn in at the Jan. 12 City Council meeting. “I basically just wanted something a little more slow-paced, where I can spend time with the family and essentially not take anything home.”</p>
<p>Preston’s hire at an annual salary of $104,484 brings some long-awaited relief to the Belvedere department, which had been operating with only four officers. That’s resulted in long shifts, schedule adjustments and part-time officers to maintain 24-hour coverage, with support from the Tiburon Police Department during extended absences, officials have said.</p>
<p>Adding Preston brings the department to five patrol officers, what officials have called “manageable” but still one below “ideal.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jim Gaither Jr. peers through his binoculars at Railroad Marsh on Jan. 14, listening for distinct bird calls echoing across the water.</p>
<p>In about 12 minutes, he’s spotted 14 bird species — mallards, pied-billed grebes, great blue herons and white-crowned sparrows — all recorded in his list on eBird, an app and website created by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.</p>
<p>“That’s more than one species a minute,” says the 63-year-old San Rafael resident, whose parents, Jim and Susan, live on the Belvedere Lagoon.</p>
<p>He points to a great blue heron perched on the marsh’s banks.</p>
<p>“As we come into late winter and spring, they start developing their breeding plumage and terrific colors and plumes,” Gaither says. “They’re just a wonderful bird.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Tiburon Peninsula residents have until 4 p.m. Feb. 3 to apply for an interim seat on the Reed Union School District board of trustees.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon Peninsula residents have until 4 p.m. Feb. 3 to apply for an interim seat on the Reed Union School District board of trustees.</p>
<p>The vacancy was created when Sherry Wangenheim resigned in December, one year before her term was set to expire. Wangenheim, who had served on the board since 2017, is moving to London with her family later this year.</p>
<p>The chosen candidate will serve the remainder of Wangenheim’s term, through early December 2026, and can run for a full four-year term in the Nov. 3 general election.</p>
<p>The district board voted 4-0 at its Jan. 13 meeting to fill the seat by appointment rather than calling for a special election, citing a desire to minimize costs and fill the vacancy sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>The seat is open to any registered voter living within school district boundaries, which include Tiburon, Belvedere, Paradise Cay and east Corte Madera.</p>
<p>Application materials are available by emailingrusdsuperintendent@reedschools.orgor for pickup at the district office, 277A Karen Way, Tiburon, at Bel Aire Elementary School. Completed applications should be sent to the same email address or dropped off at the district office.</p>
<p>Applicants must be available to be interviewed at a special Feb. 6 board meeting, which will be open to the public. The board is expected to make an appointment immediately following the interviews.</p>
<p>For more information, call the district office at 415-381-1112.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Point Tiburon Plaza parking lot could get nine townhomes</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/point-tiburon-plaza-parking-lot-could-get-nine-townhomes</link>
     <description>A developer plans to build nine three-story townhomes under state laws that would override zoning requirements for lot size and density.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A developer plans to build nine three-story townhomes on part of the Point Tiburon Plaza parking lot under state laws that would override Tiburon’s zoning requirements for lot size and density.</p>
<p>Black Oak Ventures is working with property owner Chong Cook to subdivide a portion of the plaza at 1801 Tiburon Blvd. into nine lots for townhomes. The lots would total 17,720 square feet of the existing 87,120-square-foot parcel. The remaining 69,400 square feet would continue as parking.</p>
<p>Tiburon received the proposal Nov. 20 under Senate Bill 1123, the Starter Home Revitalization Act. Under the law, towns must ministerially approve qualifying projects — automatic approval if objective standards are met, with no public hearings or discretionary review. SB 1123 applies to developments of 10 homes or fewer on vacant lots in single-family zones, expanding on SB 684, which created the streamlined process for up to 10 units on lots zoned for multifamily development.</p>
<p>While the law requires approval or denial within 60 days of receiving a completed application, Senior Planner Neal Toft said Jan. 16 the town notified the owner and developer Dec. 19 that the application was incomplete — “so no decision is required at this time,” Toft said.</p>
<p>Black Oak Ventures founder and managing partner Michael Yarne told The Ark in a Jan. 16 phone interview he intends to refile a completed application by late January or early February, restarting the 60-day review window.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Bridget Hirst</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/bridget-hirst</link>
     <description>Bridget Hirst, aged 95, passed away peacefully on December 26, 2025.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bridget Hirst, aged 95, passed away peacefully on December 26, 2025, in San Rafael, California.</p>
<p>Born on September 14, 1930, in South Mimms, England, to Charles and Margaret Carlton, Bridget’s early years were shaped by her education at various English boarding schools beginning at the age of seven. She quickly distinguished herself in English, poetry, and drama — subjects that would remain close to her heart throughout her life. Her passion for the arts led her to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Though she ultimately decided against an acting career, her creative spirit found new expression when she enrolled at the Paris Academy to study pattern cutting and dress design. There, she also mastered the art of walking in high heels and gracefully entering and exiting a sports car — skills she later described with characteristic humor as “useless but great fun.”</p>
<p>Bridget began her professional career as a pattern cutter at Horrockses before moving on to work as a designer at C&A in Manchester. One of her favorite tasks involved reviewing daily newspapers for photographs of Princess Margaret and recreating the royal’s outfits for ready-to-wear collections.</p>
<p>In 1956, Bridget married Michael Hirst and later settled in Cuckfield, Sussex, where she owned and managed a nursery school for 10 years. After their divorce in 1976, she moved to Hove, Sussex. She loved living by the sea, but in 2014, as her health began to decline, Bridget relocated to California to be closer to her family. She first moved into Drakes Terrace in San Rafael and spent the last five years of her life at Three Home Village, also in San Rafael.</p>
<p>Bridget was a devoted mother and grandmother. She is survived by her son David and his wife Jill from Sai Kung, Hong Kong; her daughter Caroline Bland and son-in-law Christopher from Tiburon, California; her much-loved granddaughter Helena Bland from London; and her sister Patricia Plimmer from New Zealand.</p>
<p>A woman of many talents and interests, Bridget was an avid reader with a deep appreciation for theater. She made many of her own clothes until her eyesight began to fail. She was also known for her extremely complex knitting patterns, creating pieces for friends and family, as well as her enjoyment of tapestry work. A passionate traveler with an adventurous spirit, she often spoke of her only regret: never making it to the Amazon or into space.</p>

     <title>Marin OKs 106-unit senior facility off North Knoll Road</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/marin-oks-106-unit-senior-facility-off-north-knoll-road</link>
     <description>The county’s approval through a state-mandated ministerial review process on Dec. 23 leaves opponents with no avenue for appeal.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marin County has approved a controversial five-story senior care facility off Strawberry’s North Knoll Road, ending more than a year of neighborhood opposition to a project that will tower over single-family homes.</p>
<p>The 106-unit, 150,655-square-foot residential care facility will stand 63 feet, 6 inches tall on a 6.6-acre hillside site now addressed as 100 Thomas Place. The county’s approval through a state-mandated ministerial review process on Dec. 23 leaves opponents with no avenue for appeal.</p>
<p>Ali Shabahangi of San Anselmo-based Spirit Living Group LLC confirmed the developers intend to apply for building permits but said it’s too early to announce a construction timeline.</p>
<p>“While project approval is an important milestone, in many ways our work is just beginning,” he said. “The next phase involves complying with each of the county’s conditions of approval through the permitting process, which is rigorous and requires detailed technical analysis, including pedestrian and roadway improvements. Only after that work is complete will we be able to establish a construction timeline.”</p>
<p>Senior Planner Megan Alton estimated the building-permit process could take six months — double the typical three months for a single-family home.</p>
<p>The facility will include 71 apartments with kitchens for independent living — 39 studios or one-bedrooms and 32 two-bedrooms or larger — and 35 assisted-living and memory-care suites without cooking facilities. A subterranean garage will provide 72 parking spaces. Common areas will include dining rooms, activity spaces, a theater, salon, library and fitness facilities. Other amenities include walking trails, a pool, bocce court and fire-truck turnaround.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere Land Co. property swaps set stage for housing development</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-land-co-property-swaps-set-stage-for-housing-development</link>
     <description>Belvedere&apos;s plan for 160 new housing units tailored 87 of those — 73 at The Boardwalk alone — to Land Co. properties.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belvedere Land Co. has completed a $63.5 million ownership restructuring among its family investors, consolidating control of 70 units across 15 properties one day after the city submitted its 2023-2031 housing element to the state for certification.</p>
<p>Though The Boardwalk shopping center does not appear on the Dec. 12 transaction list, the internal moves were largely designed around simplifying the ownership structure of the downtown site to facilitate anticipated mixed-use redevelopment there, Land Co. family representative Jim Allen said last week.</p>
<p>Allen said property swaps narrowing The Boardwalk ownership group shifted equity among existing family owners, with each family group now controlling whole properties rather than fractional pieces across the portfolio. The swaps range from 532 San Rafael Ave., valued at $1.23 million and representing two units at 528, 532 and 536 San Rafael Ave., to the $18.4 million Ark apartments complex at 7 Cove Road site, a three-building, 20-unit parcel that also includes 11 Cove Road and 25 Beach Road.</p>
<p>The timing of the Land Co. restructuring is significant. It follows a multiyear effort in which Belvedere was required to plan for at least 160 new housing units. The city tailored 87 of those — 73 at The Boardwalk alone — to Land Co. properties. The City Council adopted its state-mandated housing element and associated rezoning Dec. 8, formalizing zoning revisions the company indicated as necessary in an August 2022 interest letter and including targeted incentives to help ensure redevelopment makes sense financially.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>The 15 Belvedere Land Co. parcels outlined in red were part of a 70-unit, $63.5-million equity swap recorded Dec. 12 that simplified family ownership of the landlord’s commercial and residential properties. The properties highlighted in blue are all owned by the Land Co. and have special zoning incentives to encourage redevelopment, representing 14 potential new units in Belvedere’s 2023-2031 housing element.

     <title>Mar West residents must raise $55K for utility-burying plans</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/mar-west-residents-must-raise-55k-for-utility-burying-plans</link>
     <description>A group of Mar West residents must raise $55,250 toward engineering and design work to bury their utility lines.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of Mar West residents moved a step closer to burying overhead power lines after the Tiburon Town Council voted to require the neighborhood to raise $55,250 toward engineering and design work — with the town covering the remaining two-thirds of costs.</p>
<p>The 4-0 vote Jan. 5 gives the proposed 39-home, 35-parcel undergrounding district a clear fundraising target: one-third of an estimated $165,760 needed for completed designs and a final engineering report that would allow property owners to vote on forming the district.</p>
<p>Thirty of the homes in the proposed district have already expressed support for the project, said Miles Daly, a Mar West resident and district proponent.</p>
<p>The proposed district spans Mar West from its intersection with Esperanza Street to past its intersection with Las Lomas Lane, stopping before the Sanitary District No. 5 of Marin facility. The trench also splits off onto Esperanza Street and Las Lomas Lane.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere&apos;s Jeanne Price spent nearly four decades reporting for Ark, championed historic landmarks</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-s-jeanne-price-spent-nearly-four-decades-reporting-for-ark-championed-historic-landmarks</link>
     <description>37-year Ark reporter Jeanne Price, who championed historic-preservation efforts in Belvedere, died Dec. 26. She was 93.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Longtime Belvedere resident Jeanne Price, who spent 37 years reporting for The Ark and was involved in local preservation efforts with the Belvedere-Tiburon Landmarks Society, died at an assisted-living facility in San Francisco on Dec. 26. She was 93.</p>
<p>Price joined The Ark in June 1975 as the newspaper’s bird columnist and went on to cover Redwood High School, Strawberry and Belvedere, along with features and environmental issues. By her retirement in 2012, Price had worked under six executive editors, five publishers and two ownership changes.</p>
<p>“Her work was especially important in raising public consciousness and awareness about the downtown marsh, a freshwater pond that could have, at the time, been easily filled in and turned into another parking lot,” former Ark editor and publisher Brad Breithaupt said in a 2012 article on Price’s retirement. “But because people had been reading for years about the bounty of birds found in the marsh, the area was protected during the 1980s redevelopment.”</p>
<p>Price won a second-place award for in-depth reporting from the California News Publishers Association in 1985 for her coverage of Strawberry’s history and the issues facing the unincorporated community. She also received a Herbert Bayard Swope Memorial Award honorable mention in 1982 for 10 feature articles she wrote the prior year.</p>
<p>When Price retired, she was The Ark’s longest tenured reporter, and her service to the paper has only been surpassed by art critic Carol Benet, who celebrated 50 years writing for the paper in 2025.</p>
<p>Price’s final year with the paper was Executive Editor Kevin Hessel’s first.</p>
<p>“Jeanne was deeply connected to the community, her institutional knowledge was invaluable and she never hesitated to share it with colleagues or use it to add context that made stories better,” he said last week. “She helped me find my footing as a newcomer. I tried to trick her into staying, suggesting she shoot for an even 40 years.”</p>
<p>Price was also a member of the Belvedere Historic Preservation Committee, which reviews property owners’ applications to have their buildings designated as historic, and she was one of the earliest members of the Belvedere-Tiburon Landmarks Society, joining months after it was formed in 1959.</p>
<p>She wrote various articles for the society’s newsletter, The Landmark, served on its board for nine years and was its representative for the Art & Garden Center’s cottage restoration. She a...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon seeks volunteers for several boards, including planning, parks, arts, disaster</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-seeks-volunteers-for-several-boards-including-planning-parks-arts-disaster</link>
     <description>Tiburon residents have until 5 p.m. Feb. 13 to apply for 15 volunteer positions on nine town and county boards and commissions.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon residents have until 5 p.m. Feb. 13 to apply for 15 volunteer positions on nine town and county boards and commissions, with terms for most seats expiring at the end of February.</p>
<p>The openings span the Planning Commission; the Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission; the Heritage and Arts Commission; the Diversity Inclusion Task Force; the Belvedere-Tiburon Library Agency; the Belvedere-Tiburon Joint Disaster Advisory Council; the Building Code Appeals Board; the Marin-Sonoma Mosquito and Vector Control District Board; and the Marin Commission on Aging.</p>
<p>All seats are unpaid, volunteer positions, and applicants must be Tiburon residents, except for the Diversity Inclusion Task Force, which is open to Belvedere residents; the Disaster Advisory Council, which is open only to residents of unincorporated Tiburon; and the Building Code Appeals Board, which includes those who work in town, though candidates must have a working knowledge of the town’s building code.</p>
<p>Planning Commission, two four-year seats:The terms of Eric Woodward and Kathleen Defever expire Feb. 28. Woodward, a member since 2019, and Defever, who was first appointed in 2018, both said they plan to reapply. The five-member board is the town’s planning agency and meets on second and fourth Wednesdays to review items such as the general plan, conditional use permits, zoning and zoning text amendments.</p>
<p>Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission, two four-year seats:The terms of Michael Moon and Liz Judge expire Feb. 28.</p>
<p>Judge, who was appointed in 2022, said she was not reapplying because of increased professional commitments that have made it “really challenging to give (the commission) all the time I feel it deserves.” Moon, who was appointed in 2023 and is currently commission chair, did not respond by press deadline to an inquiry about whether he planned to reapply. The five-member commission meets on third Tuesdays every other month and makes recommendations to the Planning Commission and Town Council on policy matters pertaining to parks and open space under the town’s jurisdiction. It also serves as the town’s Bicycle-Pedestrian Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Heritage and Arts Commission, two four-year seats:The terms of Jaleh Etemad, who’s served since 2018, and Azita de Mujica, a commissioner since 2010, expire Feb. 28, and both said they will reapply. The seven-person commission meets on fourth Tuesdays with a mission to promote arts programs on the T...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Natalia Settembrini Casillas passed away on November 13, 2025, at the age of 83.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Natalia Settembrini Casillas passed away on November 13, 2025, at the age of 83, after a courageous battle with heart disease. She died peacefully, at home in Tiburon, surrounded by loved ones. She was the love of my life and my best friend.</p>
<p>Natalia was born in Puglia, a peninsula in Southern Italy surrounded by turquoise waters and white sandy beaches. Natalia loved to cook and entertain her family and friends. She often hosted large lunch and dinner parties at “Villa Natalia,” her beautiful hilltop home in Tiburon, with its panoramic views of the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, and the Bay, as well as the home’s terraces, tiles, and gardens that reminded her of the Amalfi Coast, one of her favorite parts of Italy.</p>
<p>Natalia is survived by her husband of 41 years, Mark Casillas of Tiburon, her two sons, five grandchildren, a great-grandson, and two sisters. A detailed obituary was published on her Facebook pagewww.facebook.com/natalia.settembrinicasillasand in the San Francisco Chronicle atwww.legacy.comorwww.bit.ly/NataliaCasillas.</p>
<p>Natalia’s funeral was at Queen of Heaven Cemetery, Lafayette, CA, where her remains reside. She would be delighted by your visit; she would greet you warmly with her beautiful smiling photo and memorial. In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to the American Heart Association.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Nature serves as inspiration for abstract works in Belvedere-Tiburon Library exhibit</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/nature-serves-as-inspiration-for-abstract-works-in-belvedere-tiburon-library-exhibit</link>
     <description>&quot;Abstracting Nature” at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library runs Jan. 15-March 11.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The inspiration for Jennifer Francis Fearon’s painting “Natural Optimism 2” came from a photo of light rippling on water.</p>
<p>The Belvedere artist made an engraved print from the photo, using a non-toxic process that included soy-based inks and Japanese paper. This print was then mounted on a wood panel and overpainted with mineral pigments.</p>
<p>For Fearon, 64, painting is a way to “stay present, to notice small movements and moments that might otherwise be missed.”</p>
<p>“My work is really about paying attention to place, to materials and to the subtle forces that connect us to the natural world we live in every day,” she says.</p>
<p>Fearon’s “Natural Optimism 2” is one of 59 works on display from as many Bay Area artists in “Abstracting Nature” at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library. The exhibit, which runs Jan. 15-March 11, showcases paintings, drawings and photographs inspired by nature and reinterpreted as abstractions.</p>
<p>An artists’ reception is set for 6-8 p.m. Jan. 15, and a free ARTtalk with environmental artist David Maisel sharing his abstract paintings and photographs is set for 6:30-7:30 p.m. Feb. 19.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Hilary Sessions is a volunteer and board member for Make It Home, which helps furnish homes for those transitioning from being unhoused.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those transitioning out of crisis, obtaining housing can provide much needed stability — but it takes a lot more than a roof over their heads to make a house feel like a home.</p>
<p>“One of the problems, if you have a family or someone that’s really on the edge, if they move into a vacant home and they don’t have any money to spend on furniture or even a bed or a desk or pots and pans, there’s a good chance that they will slip back into the system because they don’t really have a home, they have a place to sleep,” says Strawberry resident Hilary Sessions.</p>
<p>That’s where Make It Home steps in — and where Sessions, 59, has found her calling as both a volunteer and a member of the organization’s board of directors. The Marin-based nonprofit furnishes homes for people in the social-welfare system, building a bridge between federally subsidized Section 8 housing and possessing a true home, an often-overlooked element in preventing recidivism.</p>]]></content:encoded>
