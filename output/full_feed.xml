     <title>Jazz guitarist returning home for Old St. Hilary’s concert July 25</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/jazz-guitarist-returning-home-for-old-st-hilary-s-concert-july-25</link>
     <description>Tiburon native Perry Smith will perform with his trio New West Guitars July 25 at Old St. Hilary’s Landmark.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guitarist Perry Smith starts each day with a cold plunge.</p>
<p>Hooking a refurbished air conditioner up to a large barrel, Smith cools the water down to 40 degrees, then sits in it for six minutes.</p>
<p>“It helps me musically and helps me mentally,” he says. “It sharpens my body and mind and improves my technique and stamina on the guitar.”</p>
<p>Smith follows up the tingly cold plunge with 150 pushups, 150 bicycle crunches, 20 minutes of jump rope, 100 more pushups and 10 minutes of stretching. Then he picks up his guitar — a custom Mirabella archtop — and hammers away for 60 minutes on technique, improvisation, recording and honing his repertoire and sight reading.</p>
<p>This regimented approach has allowed Smith, 42, to build more than two decades of success as a jazz musician. The Tiburon native will perform with his trio New West Guitars July 25 at Old St. Hilary’s Landmark in a concert hosted by the Belvedere-Tiburon Landmarks Society — a sweet homecoming for the Brooklyn-based jazz guitarist whose career has brought him all around world.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A well-traveled resident is grateful to call Tiburon home</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-well-traveled-resident-is-grateful-to-call-tiburon-home</link>
     <description>Haines grew up living in several countries due to his father’s work in humanitarian relief.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throw a dart at a world map, and chances are David Haines has visited there, from Virginia, Seattle, New York and Washington, D.C., to Malaysia, Singapore, Switzerland, France, Italy, the U.K., Guatemala and Peru.</p>
<p>Having traveled the world, Haines, 75, says he feels grateful to have called Tiburon home for some 45 years.</p>
<p>“I count my blessings every day for the opportunity to live here,” he says as he sits with his dog, Fletcher, on a bench overlooking Greenwood and Brunini beaches near Blackie’s Pasture on July 9. “I mean, I couldn’t pick a more beautiful place in the world, and I’ve seen a lot of beautiful places.”</p>
<p>Haines grew up living in several countries due to his father’s work in humanitarian relief, helping those affected by disasters and building orphanages. Whenever disaster struck, “he would mobilize volunteers and people he recruited — engineers, nurses, doctors, whatever needed — to go into an area and help rebuild it,” Haines says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Travel Bug: Mediterranean cruise crosses continents and cultures</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/travel-bug-mediterranean-cruise-crosses-continents-and-cultures</link>
     <description>Over 11 days, the Travel Bug explored two continents and four countries, immersing ourselves in rich culture and history while celebrating a milestone anniversary.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Gaudí’s whimsical architecture in Barcelona and the red-and-white arches of Córdoba’s Great Mosque to the soaring Gothic cathedral of Seville and the vibrant souks of Marrakesh, our Windstar cruise from Barcelona to Lisbon fed my husband’s and my wanderlust in every way. Over 11 days aboard the intimate Star Legend, we explored two continents and four countries — Spain, Gibraltar, Morocco and Portugal — immersing ourselves in rich culture and history while celebrating a milestone anniversary.</p>
<p>We began our journey with a blissfully relaxing sea day, a much-needed pause after the hustle of getting to Barcelona. We buzzed around the city for two full days to take in Gaudí’s masterpieces, including the awe-inspiring Sagrada Família and his whimsical home-turned-museum. Once aboard the ship, the pace shifted. I slipped easily into vacation mode, rotating between naps, reading, grazing at the buffet and lounging by the pool. Others booked spa treatments, played dominoes or joined enriching onboard lectures.</p>
<p>The Star Legend, a luxury small ship with only 156 suites and a maximum of 312 guests, felt intimate and friendly. We weren’t the only ones celebrating something special. Birthdays, retirements, anniversaries — almost every table had a story. On our second night, we toasted with Dave and Jenny, a retired couple from North Carolina who were on their third Windstar cruise. As we sailed along Spain’s glittering coast, it was easy to see why they kept coming back.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere probes cyberattack as report warns of rising risks</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-probes-cyberattack-as-report-warns-of-rising-risks</link>
     <description>The May 28 breach occurred just a month before a Marin civil grand jury report about vulnerabilities across the county&apos;s independent networks.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere is investigating a May cybersecurity incident that prompted the city to temporarily shut down its servers and network systems as officials work to determine whether any sensitive data was compromised.</p>
<p>The May 28 breach occurred just one month before the Marin County civil grand jury released a June 27 report documenting two major cyberattacks since 2024 that cost local agencies nearly $1 million and exposed vulnerabilities across the county’s independent networks.</p>
<p>City Manager Robert Zadnik said officials have identified the type of cyberattack but declined to share additional details, citing security risks. The city is working with the California Intergovernmental Risk Authority to investigate the incident, including whether any resident data or financial information was compromised.</p>
<p>“It was an annoying inconvenience,” Zadnik said. “But also an opportunity to see where some vulnerabilities may lie and make improvements.”</p>
<p>He said the investigation is expected to wrap up in a couple of months and that he hopes to update the City Council later this summer or in early fall.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Redwood&apos;s John Anderluh was named an All-Academic honoree, and Lucy Jeffers is an All-American.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two Tiburon teens have earned honors from USA Lacrosse for their standout 2025 seasons.</p>
<p>John Anderluh, who graduated from Redwood High School in May, was named an All-Academic honoree by the organization, which governs men’s and women’s lacrosse across the U.S., while Lucy Jeffers, a rising Redwood senior, was named an All-American honoree.</p>
<p>Anderluh and Jeffers were each one of 500 student-athletes to earn the recognition in their respective categories. The All-Academic award honors student athletes who not only exhibit exemplary skills and good sportsmanship on the field but high standards in the classroom, while the All-American award honors players who possess superior skills and standout game sense and knowledge.</p>
<p>USA Lacrosse oversees the selection for both awards, based on voting by coaches within each geographical area.</p>
<p>Both Anderluh and Jeffers led their teams to strong seasons and into the Marin County Athletic League playoffs, where both of their teams fell in their respective championship games to Marin Catholic High School.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Pandemic piano hobby turns into a Billboard-charting music career</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/pandemic-piano-hobby-turns-into-a-billboard-charting-music-career</link>
     <description>Her single “Move Your Body Slowly&quot; reached No. 26 on Billboard’s adult-contemporary chart.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon resident Rongrong Souang began teaching herself piano during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, watching YouTube clips to learn chords.</p>
<p>Her husband, however, challenged her to learn on her own, so she wouldn’t be influenced by other styles. She finally decided to give it a try — if only to prove him wrong and put an end to what she says is the only real argument they’ve ever had.</p>
<p>“Let me show you that I really can’t do this today,” she recalls telling her husband. “I’m going to give it a very honest try on it. I will give my best effort, sit at the piano and try to write something. If I can’t, let’s just drop it so we don’t have to fight anymore.”</p>
<p>That same day, she wrote three songs.</p>
<p>Today, the 37-year-old Souang is a budding pop singer who goes by the stage name Miist, with songs that have appeared on — and topped — Billboard and other music-industry charts. Her single “Move Your Body Slowly,” an infectious dance-pop track with a music video filmed at a Belvedere Avenue mansion, reached No. 26 on Billboard’s adult-contemporary chart. The same song hit No. 1 on the indie adult-contemporary chart organized by Mediabase, a music-industry metrics tracker.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Concert posters from The Fillmore line the walls, and a stout bulldog sits at his feet.</p>
<p>Meagher was working out of the garage July 1, just as he does every workday, leaving the garage door open even during the winter.</p>
<p>“I have an option of closing this door and being locked in here,” he says. “But I’d much rather have it open and see people all day long.”</p>
<p>Meagher is an advertising sales rep who has been working remotely from his open-door “man cave” since he and his wife moved into their Belvedere Land Co.-owned home three years ago.

     <title>From prison to podium: Tiburon man finds second chance at life through running</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/from-prison-to-podium-tiburon-man-finds-second-chance-at-life-through-running</link>
     <description>Markelle Taylor began running in 2015 while incarcerated at San Quentin Rehabilitation Center, where he was quickly dubbed “Markelle The Gazelle.”</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the path to becoming a gold-medal long-distance runner, Tiburon resident Markelle Taylor says he’s learned how to overcome adversity.</p>
<p>He likens taking on life’s challenges to lifting weights.</p>
<p>“It’s the pain and the suffering you go through in that and your muscles getting weaker and fatigued, but then you have a resting period, and it builds back stronger,” Taylor says. “And that’s what I’m doing.”</p>
<p>Taylor, 52, began running in 2015 while incarcerated at San Quentin Rehabilitation Center, where he joined the facility’s 1,000 Mile Club and was quickly dubbed “Markelle The Gazelle.” He ran several marathons during his incarceration, using his time from his last prison marathon to qualify for the 2019 Boston Marathon after his release that year.</p>
<p>Since then, he estimates he’s run a dozen marathons across the U.S. and internationally, with a personal best time of 2 hours, 48 minutes. In March, he helped the U.S. win gold as part of a three-man 10K team at the World Masters Athletics Indoor Championships in Florida.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon fire budget plans for Paradise Drive station remodel to start in August</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-fire-budget-plans-for-paradise-drive-station-remodel-to-start-in-august</link>
     <description>The remodel of Station 10 on Paradise Drive at Trestle Glen Boulevard accounts for about 22% of the district’s total anticipated expenditures in fiscal 2026.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Fire Protection District’s $16.7-million budget for fiscal 2025-2026 includes $3.6 million toward the planned remodel of its Paradise Drive station, with construction set to begin in August, along with repairs and upgrades to its downtown station.</p>
<p>The district’s board of directors unanimously approved the break-even budget June 24 ahead of the new fiscal year, which began July 1.</p>
<p>The remodel of Station 10 on Paradise Drive at Trestle Glen Boulevard accounts for about 22% of the district’s total anticipated expenditures in fiscal 2026 and has been in the works for several years. It was originally built in the 1960s as a two-stall station for volunteer firefighters and has since expanded to about 4,000 square feet to include living quarters for on-duty staff and additional fire apparatus.</p>
<p>The district, which serves the town southeast of Trestle Glen Boulevard, unincorporated Tiburon along Paradise Drive and all of Belvedere, will replace the current building with a 4,952-square-foot station and 124-square-foot training tower. The main building will include an apparatus bay for two vehicles with a decontamination room and a 2,485-square-foot living area with five dorms, three gender-neutral bathrooms, an office, dining room, kitchen, gym, laundry room and dayroom.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>NASA ember-risk maps show threats to Tiburon homes</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/nasa-ember-risk-maps-show-threats-to-tiburon-homes</link>
     <description>New satellite data highlights areas where vegetation could fuel 
spot fires; agencies promote defensible space to minimize risks</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA Ames Research Center has released new maps showing Tiburon Peninsula areas at risk from flying embers during wildfires, with zones along the western and southern Tiburon Ridge, Ring Mountain and Angel Island highlighted as potential sources of dangerous firebrands.</p>
<p>NASA earth scientist Chris Potter said embers — glowing, hot particles of vegetation that float through the air during wildfire — pose a threat to Tiburon homes this fire season.</p>
<p>“The wind blows and casts the embers toward your town,” he said. “Toward the roofs and vents of your homes — which are the most dangerous places for an ember to land.”</p>
<p>NASA, in collaboration with the nonprofit Santa Clara County FireSafe Council, released maps in June that display Bay Area spots at greatest risk of sparking flying embers. Using satellite data collected since the 1970s, the maps show dark red regions where vegetation type and density are particularly ember-prone, including areas that border the southern Tiburon Ridge, Acacia Drive, Seafirth, Norman Estates, Del Madera, Hacienda Heights, Mount Tiburon, Upper Sugarloaf and Marinero, Vistazo West, Hill Haven and Lyford Cove/Old Tiburon neighborhoods. Along the western ridge, near Highway 101, ember-prone areas abut the Eagle Rock, Bayview Terrace, Upper Via Los Altos, Tiburon Crest and Reedlands neighborhoods.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>A NASA satellite map released in June shows ember risk levels across the North Bay, with darker red areas indicating vegetation most likely to produce dangerous flying embers during wildfires, with an inset highlighting the Tiburon Peninsula. The map combines decades of satellite data to identify where vegetation types and density create the highest risk for embers that can travel one to two miles from wildfire sources to threaten homes.

     <description>Highlow Larder reflects owner Elizabeth Smith-Finders&apos; journey from social work to Michelin-starred kitchens.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elizabeth Smith-Finders has traveled around the world honing her culinary skills, learning from industry titans, interning at three-starred Michelin restaurants and cooking dishes for ultra-wealthy clientele.</p>
<p>Those experiences taught her that cooking and entertaining can involve “a lot of gatekeeping,” contrasting with her belief that everyone should have access to shared moments around the table.</p>
<p>“I think that it’s one of the most beautiful things that we have are those traditions and those interactions, and I want people to feel really empowered and proud to host and to gather at wherever they’re at,” she says.</p>
<p>That philosophy led Smith-Finders, 44, to Highlow Larder. She founded and owns the cooking and home-goods store that opened May 31 at 32 Main St., replacing Knit House on Main.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Tiburon resident Rand Crook is a writer and film producer whose credits include the 1996 indie movie ‘Chalk.&apos;</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing up in Charlotte, North Carolina, and moving to the Bay Area at 19, Rand Crook says he was inspired to attend film school by his experiences as a child actor in commercials. He appeared in ads for St. Joseph Aspirin and MasterCard, back when it was known as Master Charge. He says he’s still looking on YouTube to find the ads he filmed.</p>
<p>He attended San Francisco State University’s film program, leading him to connect with director Rob Nilsson, with whom he worked on films including “On the Edge,” “Heat and Sunlight” and “Chalk,” an indie classic involving a lazy yet gifted pool hustler who takes on a high-stakes contender after learning his stepfather has cancer. Crook also produced “Chalk,” which featured amateur actors from the Tenderloin Action Group, a actors’ workshop for the homeless in San Francisco.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Strawberry rec district plans for deficit to finance new playground</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-rec-district-plans-for-deficit-to-finance-new-playground</link>
     <description>The district aims to have the new playground complete by summer 2026.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Strawberry Recreation District is projecting a nearly $850,000 deficit this fiscal year, driven primarily by the cost of building a new playground at its East Strawberry Drive facility.</p>
<p>The district’s board of directors voted unanimously in May to approve the $4.32 million budget for fiscal 2025-2026, which began July 1. That’s against an anticipated $3.47 million in revenue, for a deficit of $848,372.</p>
<p>General Manager Nancy Shapiro said the deficit is planned, as the district knew it would have to dip into reserves to pay for the new play area. The playground is planned for the second floor of the facility outside the gym’s south entrance, to replace Reggie Park. That playground, located between the main building and tennis courts, was removed to make way for a new sport court for pickleball and basketball that opened in September 2024.</p>
<p>The playground cost is estimated at about $1 million, which Shapiro said is based on observing excavation costs to build the sport court and her conversations with playground companies. The district aims to have the new playground complete by summer 2026, though there’s currently no firm timeline for construction.</p>]]></content:encoded>
