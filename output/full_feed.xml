     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere officials are pushing back against a Marin civil grand jury report that criticizes local jurisdictions for failing to meet state housing goals, with Mayor Jane Cooper calling it a “one-size-fits-all” approach that ignores the city’s unique circumstances.</p>
<p>In a 4-0 vote Sept. 8, the City Council approved a formal response that disputed six of nine findings in the grand jury’s June report titled “The Worrisome Future of Marin Housing.” The legally required response will be signed by Cooper and returned to the grand jury.</p>
<p>“One of the most problematic issues with (the California Department of Housing and Community Development) that we face in Marin is their one-size-fits-all laws for everyone, no matter the size of the community or amount of land,” Cooper said at the meeting. “And now the grand jury is doing the same thing without regard for the individual differences, with statements such as ‘all Marin cities and towns should.’”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Richardson Bay’s few remaining anchor-outs may have lost their chance at subsidized onshore housing after the agency that manages the bay put its rental assistance program on hold.</p>
<p>The Marin Housing Authority in May asked the Richardson Bay Regional Agency to stop accepting applicants into its temporary-support housing program, saying it could no longer offer the federal vouchers meant to provide long-term rental assistance.</p>
<p>“We do not have the vouchers to proceed with the remaining people on the anchorage,” said Marin Housing Authority Executive Director Kimberly Carroll, citing “budget issues with the federal government.”</p>
<p>The request became public last week as part of the agency board’s Sept. 11 meeting.</p>
<p>The agency program, funded by a $3 million state grant, provides temporary one-year housing vouchers to anchor-outs living on boats on Richardson Bay who wish to move ashore. The program has been key to clearing derelict boats off the bay.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon fire officials adopt $16.7-million budget with funds for construction, upgrades</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-fire-officials-adopt-16-7-million-budget-with-funds-for-construction-upgrades</link>
     <description>Board adopts spending plan as construction begins on Paradise Drive fire station replacement.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Fire Protection District adopted a $16.7 million budget for fiscal 2025-2026 that includes $3.6 million toward the remodel of its Paradise Drive station, where construction began earlier this month. The budget also includes repairs and upgrades to the district’s downtown station.</p>
<p>The district’s board of directors voted 4-0 at its Sept. 10 meeting to approve the break-even budget, with board member Cheryl Woodford absent. The budget showed minimal changes from a preliminary budget approved in June, ahead of the July 1 start of the new fiscal year.</p>
<p>The remodel of Station 10 on Paradise Drive at Trestle Glen Boulevard accounts for about 22% of the district’s total anticipated expenditures in fiscal 2026. The project has been in the works for several years. The station was originally built in the 1960s as a two-stall facility for volunteer firefighters and has since expanded to about 4,000 square feet to include living quarters for on-duty staff and additional fire apparatus.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Medical professionals from New Hampshire and Southern California discover friendship in Marin.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>San Rafael resident Janessa Bowen (left) and new Tiburon resident Hannah Cashman have known each other for 2½ years, meeting through their jobs as an ultrasound technician and an X-ray technician, respectively.</p>
<p>Hannah Cashman says she’s enjoying her new stomping grounds after moving to Tiburon from Novato about three weeks ago.</p>
<p>She says she’s been enjoying the views and that she can walk to downtown from her new residence.</p>
<p>“I liked the aspect of being close to the city because I grew up in such a small town in New Hampshire that this is so big for me, and I love it,” Cashman says. “I love the outdoor life, but then I can also cross that bridge and have that city life.”</p>
<p>Cashman was hanging out with friend and San Rafael resident Janessa Bowen at Shoreline Park on Sept. 9. The two have known each other for roughly 2½ years through their work; Cashman is an X-ray technician, and Bowen is an ultrasound technician.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Artists convey emotions, thoughts in latest Belvedere-Tiburon Library exhibit</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/artists-convey-emotions-thoughts-in-latest-belvedere-tiburon-library-exhibit</link>
     <description>&apos;Interpretations&apos; features abstracts from local and regional artists.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 60 artists will showcase works that convey their emotions, ideas and thoughts through visual elements in the latest Belvedere-Tiburon Library exhibit, “Interpretations: Color, Line, Form.”</p>
<p>The show runs Sept. 18-Nov. 14, with an artist’s reception 6-8 p.m. Sept. 18.</p>
<p>“With non-representational art, artists aren’t going for verisimilitude,” says Diane Green, the library’s art committee co-chair. “Their art is more of an internal dialogue captured through the creative process. And the immediacy of a show like this is how the artists reveal emotional states through their medium of choice.”</p>
<p>Among the 58 artists contributing works to the show is Tiburon’s Anki Gelb with “Shoreline Waves.”</p>
<p>Though she prefers to work with oils, the piece is an acrylic on board and is one of five in a series titled “Coastal Fragments.”</p>
<p>“My inspiration for this collection is the rugged coastline of Big Sur, where the Pacific meets California’s wild edges,” says Gelb, 68. “It reflects the ocean’s quiet intensity and calm power.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Local Tiburon Band brings classic rock hits to charity events and community gatherings</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/local-tiburon-band-brings-classic-rock-hits-to-charity-events-and-community-gatherings</link>
     <description>From jam sessions to center stage.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six Tiburon Peninsula residents have discovered that forming a rock cover band offers more than just musical expression — it’s become a cornerstone of community connection.</p>
<p>Local Tiburon Band, a classic rock cover group, has evolved from casual jam sessions into a regular fixture at area venues and charity events. The six-member ensemble recently headlined the fourth annual Scotty Lapp Foundation Event on Sept. 12, helping raise nearly $100,000 for youth sports programs.</p>
<p>The charity performance represents the band’s community-focused approach to rock music. It began playing in 2022 with small shows on the dock of Sam’s Anchor Cafe. Since then, the group has grown into a regular act at the Sausalito Cruising Club and played to a packed downtown street during Tiburon’s Friday Nights on Main.</p>
<p>Local Tiburon Band brings together musicians from varied professional backgrounds: Peter Gillespie, executive director of Tokyo-based financial services group Nomura, on lead guitar; Jennings on drums; Rob Acker, CEO of HUBBL technologies, on guitar, piano and vocals; Nick Agrawal, who works for Salesforce, on guitar and vocals; attorney Joleen Lenihan on vocals; and Tim Baker on bass.</p>
<p>“What I love doing is playing for friends,” said Acker. “It’s an excuse to throw a party and have fun.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere sets strict path to undo historic home designation</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-sets-strict-path-to-undo-historic-home-designation</link>
     <description>Tax-break loss sparks debate over fairness and preservation.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere residents who own historic homes can now request the designation be removed — but in most cases, they’ll have to win approval from two city boards and pay a fee.</p>
<p>The City Council voted 4-0 on Sept. 8, with member Peter Mark absent, to add a new chapter to the city’s municipal code creating a process to decertify historic homes. Councilmembers agreed they generally wanted that process to be a strict one, given the importance the city has placed on protecting historic and architecturally significant homes.</p>
<p>“From my perspective, the historic homes help make Belvedere what it is,” said Mayor Jane Cooper. “We’re all very proud of the homes and how they add to the community and the city and the history involved with them. And people certainly appreciate them and cherish them.”</p>
<p>The council will conduct a second, required reading and vote on the ordinance at its Oct. 13 meeting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Traffic agency, Belvedere back bike-lane removal in Caltrans’ final draft</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/traffic-agency-belvedere-back-bike-lane-removal-in-caltrans-final-draft</link>
     <description>Cyclists show school buses skip stops, fit in others, undermining safety claims.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local agencies are endorsing Caltrans’ latest design plans that remove contentious bike lanes from next summer’s Tiburon Boulevard maintenance project, citing school-bus safety concerns. But cycling advocates are disputing those claims with field observations showing buses are skipping supposedly “critical” stops, picking up outside proposed lane areas and operating safely in similar conditions elsewhere.</p>
<p>Caltrans spokesperson Matt O’Donnell confirmed Sept. 11 that the new design plans postpone construction of proposed bike-lane segments between Blackfield Drive and Trestle Glen Boulevard from Phase 1 of the 4.6-mile, $15-million project to an as-yet-unfunded second phase. This follows suggestions in a July 22 internal document obtained and previously reported by The Ark.</p>
<p>The yearlong project, set to start in summer 2026, spans state-owned Highway 131 from Mill Valley to Tiburon’s Main Street.</p>
<p>The new plans restore a multiuse path to East Strawberry Drive and include broadband-conduit installation in Phase 1. They represent an end-stage draft before final construction plans are created. Those are expected this month, O’Donnell said.</p>
<p>The Tiburon Peninsula Traffic Alliance, which operates the bus program for Tiburon schools, and Belvedere City Council approved letters last week supporting the final draft. Reed Union School District Superintendent Kimberly McGrath also continued to back the removal of the lanes for student-safety reasons.</p>
<p>However, bicycle advocacy groups WTB-TAM and the Marin County Bicycle Coalition jointly submitted their own letter criticizing Caltrans for backing out while challenging the safety rationale behind the revisions.</p>
<p>Observations challenge safety claims</p>
<p>With school back in session, WTB-TAM observed Reed Elementary School’s morning bus route skip the scheduled inbound Cecilia Way stop on Aug. 29 and Sept. 5. The traffic alliance claims this stop is critical to operations and would be eliminated by bus provider First Student under its safety policies if the bike lane were installed. The Ark also observed the same bus route drive past the Cecilia Way stop Sept. 12.</p>
<p>WTB-TAM also noted the actual site of a second critical inbound stop at Blackie’s Pasture sits beyond where the bike lanes were planned to end in previous design iterations, eliminating another potential conflict.</p>
<p>The traffic alliance has said First Student won’t serve a bus stop that blocks a bike lane an...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>A diagram from bicycle advocacy group WTB-TAM shows measurements at the inbound 76 gas station school-bus stop on Tiburon Boulevard, documenting 22 feet between the curb and vehicle travel lane. A standard school bus is 8½ feet wide. The cycling advocates argue there’s sufficient space for school buses to load students at the sidewalk without blocking proposed bike lanes, challenging claims from the Tiburon Peninsula Traffic Alliance bus program that the lanes would create safety conflicts that either force kids to load in the lanes or block lanes and force cyclists into traffic.

     <description>al real estate analyst&apos;s 2010 painting class gift from wife leads to debut solo show.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his late 30s, commercial real-estate analyst Brian Higgins received an unexpected Christmas gift from his wife: A painting class.</p>
<p>Higgins had long worked with what he calls his “analytical” mind, first earning a law degree from the University of California College of the Law at San Francisco, then called UC Hastings, in the 1990s, then building a career in commercial real estate. The introduction to painting class, he says, awakened something he’d lost long ago.</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, the Belvedere resident has landed his first solo art exhibition. “Ascend: The Evolution of Identity” will be held Sept. 30-Oct. 11 at the Alessandro Berni Gallery in New York City. Beyond a collection of his impressionism-meets-abstraction paintings, the exhibition will also feature a live painting performance, during which Higgins will create a full piece before an audience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Margaret Rose Sloan Peterson of Tiburon died July 29, 2025, at age 87.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Margaret Rose Sloan Peterson was born on March 31, 1938, in Ilford, Essex, England. The family relocated to Liverpool during World War II after her father, James Sloan, passed away from pneumonia. Margaret grew up in a loving and supportive household with her mother, Doris Moss Sloan; her aunts Margaret, Eva, and Florence; her brother, John Dennis Leslie; and sister, Catherine Elizabeth. Extended family and cousins lived nearby, and she formed lifelong friendships with the McDonald sisters, Isabel, Pamela, and Christine, who became like family to her and they remained very close throughout her life.</p>
<p>In 1963, Margaret’s adventurous spirit brought her to San Francisco. She embraced the scene and remained in the San Francisco Bay Area for the rest of her life. She met her husband, James Francis Peterson of San Francisco, and they married in England before settling in Tiburon.</p>
<p>Together they had two children. After they divorced in 1974, Margaret remained in Tiburon, cherishing its views, community, and natural beauty. She enjoyed traveling, films, reading, classical music, positive vibes, and wildflower walks on the hilltops. Always friendly, positive, and curious, she loved chatting with neighbors, passersby, and striking up friendly exchanges with people during her travels.</p>
<p>Margaret made personal connections with everyone and cultivated friendships across generations and continents, staying in touch through heartfelt letters and cards, always timing birthday cards to arrive precisely on the day.</p>
<p>Professionally, Margaret was instrumental at the Tiburon Belvedere Childcare Center, housed in the old Tiburon Elementary School. Afterwards, she was a legal secretary, taking the ferry and knitting many sweaters and baby gifts while she commuted to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Margaret was Mother Earth personified. She lived with minimal impact and was an ardent environmentalist, advocating for sustainability and conservation long before it was mainstream. As her last earthly gesture, she donated her body to the Stanford Anatomical Gift Program.</p>
<p>Margaret passed away peacefully in her home, surrounded by love, on July 29, 2025. She was 87 years old. Her gentle kindness and many loving connections will be remembered always.</p>
<p>She is survived by her children, Timothy James (Delia Marie) and Kristina Catherine (David Thompson); grandchildren Fiona Bridget, Riley Sloan, Kevin James, Caitlin Rose, Christine Kelly, and Dexter James Sloan...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert (Bob) Bernheim, a devoted family man, passionate sailor, and community leader, was born in San Francisco on September 26, 1933. He grew up in the city, spending cherished summers at his parents’ home on Corinthian Island, where his love for the sea first took root.</p>
<p>Bob earned dual degrees in business and engineering from UC Berkeley and proudly served as a captain in the Army Corps of Engineers in the late 1950s. Following his service, he took the helm of Coast Counties Property Management, a company founded by his father, Jules, and later joined by his son, Brad, continuing the family legacy.</p>
<p>Deeply committed to his community, Bob served as a member and president of BOMA, the Building Owners and Managers Association, as well as a member of the Belvedere Planning Commission and the Rotary Club.</p>
<p>A lover of life both on land and water, Bob’s passion for the sea was infectious. His motto: “Feeling sick? Get out on the water. Feeling blue? Go sailing. Broken arm? Water’s the cure,” was a guiding principle throughout his life, even into his final months.</p>
<p>Bob was an active member of the St. Francis Yacht Club, the San Francisco Yacht Club, and the Cruising Club of America. In the early 1950s, he joined the International 210 fleet with his boat, Top Banana, winning numerous races. Over the years, he competed in Bay Area classics, the Transpac, and voyages to Mexico. His fleet of boats included a Moon boat, a Clipper, a Rhodes 33, and, later, powerboats such as a Trojan, Grand Banks, and Grand Alaskan. In his later years, he found joy in watching junior sailors and gazing out at the bay from his home on Corinthian Island.</p>
<p>Bob’s adventurous spirit extended beyond sailing. He traveled extensively with his family, exploring new places across the U.S. and abroad. A lover of the arts, he was passionate about theater and never missed a performance at SF Broadway, enjoying everything from classical musicals to Green Day.</p>
<p>He also had a sweet tooth, delighting in pie, cookies, ice cream, and especially See’s Candy. Marin Joe’s, his favorite local restaurant, was a frequent gathering spot for him and his loved ones.</p>
<p>Holidays and time with family brought Bob immense joy. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Susan, and his stepson, Walter Finch. He is survived by his son, Brad (Cynthia); daughter, Brenda “BB” (Carl Straub); stepdaughter, Susie Finch (Sandra Cook); daughter-in-law, Lauren Finch; grandson, Nich...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Ex-mayor pitches pedestrian tunnel to trail near Del Mar</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/ex-mayor-pitches-pedestrian-tunnel-to-trail-near-del-mar</link>
     <description>&quot;Light bulb moment&quot; envisions 22-foot connection between neighborhoods and Old Rail Trail, but councilmembers want traffic reduction first.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former Tiburon mayor is pitching a new idea he says could reduce traffic congestion and increase safety along Tiburon Boulevard: a pedestrian and bike tunnel that would run underneath the road and connect the Old Rail Trail to the Del Mar Middle School tennis courts, where it would then meet an existing pedestrian path that leads to the Reed Heights-Tiburon Knolls and Del Mar neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Andrew Thompson said he has spent about seven months talking about the idea with neighbors, town staff and Reed Union School District officials, as well as a tunnel-construction company headed by a Tiburon resident, though he declined to name the company.</p>
<p>For now, the idea is just that — a suggestion, both Thompson and Town Manager Greg Chanis said, with Chanis noting the town is treating the idea like all resident-submitted traffic ideas, including forwarding it to Parametrix, a consultant working on a traffic study of Tiburon Boulevard, Paradise Drive and Trestle Glen Boulevard. A draft of the study is expected to be presented to the Town Council in November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Dead coyote in Belvedere likely pup of mated pair, expert says</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/dead-coyote-in-belvedere-likely-pup-of-mated-pair-expert-says</link>
     <description>Second coyote death in a year raises questions about poisoning, while experts say lethal control methods don&apos;t work anyway.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A coyote found dead in a Golden Gate Avenue driveway Aug. 22 was likely a 5-month-old pup of Belvedere’s resident mated pair, according to the city’s wildlife expert.</p>
<p>Despite initial concerns the pup may have been poisoned or killed on purpose, consultant Rebecca Dmytryk ofHumane Wildlife Controlsaid there were no obvious signs of poisoning, though a toxicology test is pending.</p>
<p>A resident reported the coyote to the Belvedere Police Department after spotting the animal about 6 feet down from the top of their driveway. Marin Humane was called to document the incident and remove the animal carcass.</p>
<p>It was the second such coyote death reported in less than a year, as a male coyote carcass was discovered by a resident on Belvedere Way in October. In that case, California Department of Fish and Wildlife toxicology tests determined the animal had likely died after ingesting antifreeze, while it also tested positive for six rodenticides, five of which were anticoagulant compounds that caused mild but nonlethal hemorrhaging.</p>
<p>It was unclear if the coyote had been exposed to the substances accidentally or intentionally amid an ongoing debate among residents about how to best deal with coyotes on the peninsula.</p>
<p>Animals can ingest anticoagulant rodenticides either by directly consuming bait, by eating rodents that have ingested the poison or by eating those rodents’ predators.</p>
<p>Local coyote family is two adults, four to five pups</p>
<p>Dmytryk said she could not comment definitively on the cause of death for the pup found Aug. 22, but she noted photographs showed that the animal’s body was not exhibiting some of the telltale signs of poisoning, including straight, stiff legs.</p>
<p>She said the results of the toxicology tests will likely take several weeks.</p>
<p>The pup was one of a litter born about five months ago to the resident male and female pair, Dmytryk said. She said she’s unsure about the exact number of pups but that Marin Humane believes it to be four or five.</p>
<p>The male adult coyote that died in October had been the mate of the resident female. Those two animals had a litter of five pups that remained on the peninsula while young but have since dispersed to other areas, Dmytryk said. The female then took on a new partner, and their current litter will follow the same pattern, she said. They’ll explore the peninsula and most will likely disperse to wider areas in the coming months, with the exception of o...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Ex-official sues Tiburon over alleged pregnancy harassment</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/ex-official-sues-tiburon-over-alleged-pregnancy-harassment</link>
     <description>Fired town official claims colleagues mocked &quot;pregnant belly and pregnant ass&quot; while manager refused to intervene.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon’s former director of administrative services is suing the town, alleging she was harassed by two of her colleagues throughout her pregnancy and upon her return from maternity leave. She also alleges top officials, including the town manager, not only failed to stop the behavior but retaliated against her when she reported it.</p>
<p>In the complaint, which was filed in Sonoma Superior Court and is currently being transferred to Marin Superior Court, Suzanne Creekmore accuses Finance Manager Troy Bassett and former Director of Community Development Dina Tasini of making disparaging remarks about her pregnancy, which she disclosed in summer 2022.</p>
<p>Bassett, who reported directly to Creekmore, allegedly called a pregnant woman’s stomach a “horrible belly” and said she was “‘pissed’ about (Creekmore’s) planned maternity leave because her temporary absence would impact (Bassett’s) ‘lifestyle,’” while Tasini reportedly mocked Creekmore’s appearance, including saying she had a “pregnant belly, and a pregnant ass!” in front of colleagues and telling Creekmore in private to “get a different job” because Creekmore “would no longer be able to perform her duties as director once her baby was born.”</p>
<p>Creekmore's claim states she was fired in April 2024. All those named in the suit declined to comment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere’s first lot-split property hits the market</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-s-first-lot-split-property-hits-the-market</link>
     <description>The city is counting on the 2022 law to help meet its 2031 housing mandate.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first new Belvedere home created under California’s lot-splitting law has hit the market.</p>
<p>Resident Christina Wang of 421 Golden Gate Ave. successfully broke off about 40% of her 22,783-square-foot parcel under 2022’s Senate Bill 9. She listed the new address, 419 Golden Gate Ave., for $4.25 million in April. The new 9,113-square-foot lot — on the southern ridge of Belvedere Island with views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Richardson Bay and Sausalito to the east and Belvedere Cove and Tiburon to the west — contains a two-bedroom, 925-square-foot residence that previously served as the larger property’s guest house.</p>
<p>It also creates one new market-rate unit in Belvedere’s housing inventory.</p>
<p>The city must add 160 new units in the state’s 2023-2031 housing cycle, and lot splits play a key role in Belvedere’s planning roadmap, projecting 27 of those units will be created under the new law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Trip hazards prompt Belvedere to flatten six mounds at playground</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/trip-hazards-prompt-belvedere-to-flatten-six-mounds-at-playground</link>
     <description>Parks officials will study liability issues and removal of the other six.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere will remove six rubber mounds from Community Park’s playground after city officials determined they pose tripping hazards to children and families using the facility.</p>
<p>The city plans to flatten the tan-colored mounds at the edge of the playground’s tanbark area and blend them into the surrounding rubberized surface. Associate Engineer Chris Barry told the Parks, Open Spaces and Lanes Committee Aug. 21 that these mounds present “more of a tripping hazard” because their coloring blends with the tanbark, making them hard to see.</p>
<p>Barry said the city expects the removal project to cost $7,000 to $10,000, with work expected to begin in mid to late September.</p>
<p>However, there are six more blue-colored mounds, and committee members said they want all 12 removed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon panel wants another look at sites for public-art ‘street signs’</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-panel-wants-another-look-at-sites-for-public-art-street-signs</link>
     <description>Tiburon Heritage and Arts Commission delays decision on $20K positive-message street sign project until September.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon officials want the artist behind a proposed public-art project to reconsider where his positive-message street signs would go before they decide whether to recommend the temporary installation.</p>
<p>The Heritage and Arts Commission voted 6-0 Aug. 26, with Commissioner Jaleh Etemad absent, to keep working with artist Scott Froschauer to refine his “The Word on the Street” proposal, aiming to review it again Sept. 23.</p>
<p>Froschauer creates vandalism-resistant signs built to U.S. Transportation Department standards but replaces the typical commands with affirmations.</p>
<p>After discussing Froschauer’s proposal at its June and July meetings, the arts board asked the artist to come back with more specific details about the signs. The most recent plans from Froschauer, who visited Tiburon Aug. 20 and met with commission Chair Arjun Gupta, call for 15 signs, which would cost a total of $20,000: $1,000 per sign and a $5,000 start-up fee. He reduced the exhibition period from one year to six months, proposing signs at Zelinsky Park, Cypress Hollow Park, Teather Park and South of the Knoll Park.</p>]]></content:encoded>
