     <title>Teen makes history with Dipsea victory</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/teen-makes-history-with-dipsea-victory</link>
     <description>Tiburon’s Audrey MacLean, 19, is first female runner between 10 and 33 to win the nation’s oldest trail race.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Audrey MacLean had long been obsessed with the Dipsea Race, the nation’s oldest trail race, since she first learned about it as a seventh grader.</p>
<p>She first ran the race in the summer before eighth grade, though she notes at the time she “wasn’t that good at running.”</p>
<p>That’s since changed. The Tiburon resident, now 19, was crowned the winner of the 114th Dipsea Race on June 8 with a time of 46 minutes, 28 seconds — 20 seconds ahead of runner-up Mark Tatum and 1 minute, 41 seconds ahead of third-place finisher and defending champion Chris Lundy. MacLean, who graduated from Redwood High School in 2023 and attended Reed Union School District schools, made history as the first female runner between the ages of 10 and 33 to win the race.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>The sixth position has been deferred since 2020 due to budget constraints and one officer on medical leave.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere is considering hiring a sixth police officer or contracting with the Tiburon Police Department for overnight coverage to address a staffing shortage that has lingered since 2020.</p>
<p>The City Council discussed the options at its June 9 meeting, directing City Manager Robert Zadnik to research both and return with an update at the council’s July meeting.</p>
<p>With the department currently operating at four duty officers, the council and residents voiced strong opinions about officer fatigue, overnight police coverage and the ultimate costs to the city.</p>
<p>Belvedere considers six officers plus Police Chief Jason Wu to be fully staffed, but the sixth position has been deferred since 2020 due to budget constraints and one officer on medical leave.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere has adopted a $14.22-million budget that prioritizes fortification of the Beach Road seawall and levee and increases funding for legal expenses amid ongoing lawsuits challenging the city’s construction- time-limit fines.</p>
<p>The City Council voted unanimously at its June 9 meeting to formally approve the fiscal 2025-2026 budget, which showed minimal increases in both revenue and expenses from the draft reviewed in May. The new fiscal year begins July 1.</p>

     <title>Reed district projects $1.8-mil deficit on $33.2-mil budget</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-district-projects-1-8-mil-deficit-on-33-2-mil-budget</link>
     <description>Several factors are driving the projected deficit, including rising special-education costs, increased personnel costs and a funding gap for foundation-sponsored programs.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Reed Union School District is projecting a $1.83-million deficit in fiscal 2026 as it provides 5% raises to its teachers and staff and plans to spend an extra $1.18 million to close a funding gap for the arts, library and technology programs partially funded by the Foundation for Reed Schools.</p>
<p>The district’s board of trustees voted unanimously at its June 10 meeting to approve the $33.15-million budget against $31.51 million in revenue for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, which begins July 1.</p>
<p>While the district is projecting slight increases in its major sources of revenue, property and parcel taxes, it’s not expecting that to be enough to keep pace with its expenditures next year and will dip into its reserves to make up the difference.</p>
<p>Chief Business Official Chris Kim said several factors are driving the projected deficit, including rising special-education costs, increased personnel costs and the funding gap between the $1.75 million raised by the foundation and the estimated $2.93-million cost of its sponsored programs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>New Business: Istanbul natives bring Troya Mediterranean restaurant to Cove</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/new-business-istanbul-natives-bring-troya-mediterranean-restaurant-to-cove</link>
     <description>In May, the Kinalilars opened Troya restaurant in The Cove shopping center, serving Turkish and Mediterranean fare.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When husband-wife duo Berk and Betul Kinalilar would speak with Marin diners visiting their 19-year-old San Francisco restaurant,Troya, they’d often receive the same comment: “Open the restaurant in Marin.”</p>
<p>Living in the most diverse and dense culinary city in the nation, they said the request didn’t make much sense.</p>
<p>“We didn’t know anything about this area,” Betul says.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until they moved to Marin in 2018, and to Corte Madera on New Year’s Eve 2020, that they noticed that sit-down options for Turkish or Mediterranean were few.</p>
<p>“Now, it makes sense,” Betul says. “Tiburon and Marin needs more Mediterranean.”</p>
<p>So the Kinalilars acted on what their customers had been telling them all along. In May, they opened a second Troya restaurant serving Turkish and Mediterranean fare in The Cove shopping center, replacing fried-chicken sandwich shop Flybird. The restaurant served its first meal May 1 and expanded dinner service to Sundays through Thursdays on June 15.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A Tiburon man’s youth included driving a queen and hijinks on the river</title>

     <description>Burkett, who turned 93 on June 15, served in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War, achieving the rank of commander.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing up in Lodi, Roy William “Bill” Burkett once had the distinction of driving around a queen — the Grape Queen, that is.</p>
<p>The title was bestowed on a woman annually from 1934 to 1980 during the September Lodi Grape Festival, a celebration of the region’s grape harvest.</p>
<p>The queen was selected based on “beauty, poise and personality,” with the winner frequently chosen ahead of time and featured in promotional materials, according to a 2004 retrospective published in the Lodi News-Sentinel.</p>
<p>The honor of driving the queen around was a big deal, but Burkett didn’t have to do much to land the job.</p>
<p>“I knew the guy that was in charge,” the Tiburon resident says while hanging out in Zelinsky Park on June 11 with friend Hannah Callaway of Berkeley. Now he’s the one getting the rides. Callaway told Burkett she’s “lucky enough to get to come and help you in your house and drive you around places.”</p>
<p>“She didn’t want to say she’s filling in as a caregiver,” Burkett says of Callaway’s help.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere: State poised to accept latest housing plan</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-state-poised-to-accept-latest-housing-plan</link>
     <description>City officials say HCD &quot;has indicated its informal approval of the proposed revisions&quot; to the 188-unit 2023-2031 housing element.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Note: This story was updated June 18 to reflect the printed edition.</p>
<p>Belvedere’s fourth attempt at an eight-year housing plan has the tentative green light from Sacramento, local officials say.</p>
<p>The city posted the479-page revised draft to its websiteJune 11 for the required seven-day public-comment period. It was expected to submit the plan to the California Department of Housing and Community Development for formal 60-day review as soon as week.</p>
<p>The draft makes no changes to the 188-unit site inventory included in the third draft of November 2024 and instead focuses on “sharpening the pencil,” Councilmember Peter Mark said in an interview, as it mostly clarifies and tweaks policies and programs at the state’s request, such as updated rezoning and development incentives.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, (the department) has indicated its informal approval of the proposed revisions, signaling that the changes address all remaining issues,” City Manager Robert Zadnik told the City Council at itsJune 9 meeting. The most recent updates, he said, were developed in part through informal consultation with housing-agency staff.</p>
<p>Belvedere must plan for at least 160 new housing units — up from 16 in the previous eight-year cycle — as part of California’s goal of2.5 million new homes by 2030. The city’s share includes 77 for lower incomes, 23 for moderate incomes and 60 for above-moderate incomes.The extra 28 units in the plan are a buffer in case some sites are not developed to projected capacities.</p>
<p>The 2023-2031 housing element was supposed to be in place 2½ years ago, by Jan. 31, 2023. Of 109 Bay Area jurisdictions, Belvedere is among justsix that remain out of compliancewith state housing law. It is the only noncompliant municipality in Marin.</p>
<p>As a result, the city faces continued penalties including a “builder’s remedy” that requires streamlined approval of certain affordable housing projects regardless of local zoning. That will end with housing element certification. However, under production shortfalls it also facesSenate Bill 423 penaltiesrequiring by-right approval of certain multifamily projects through at least 2027. So far, however, no developers have attempted to use either penalty provision.</p>
<p>The housing agency’sJan. 14 rejection letterof Belvedere’s third draft contained mostly good news for city planners. The state accepted projections that 32 accessory dwelling units would be created and that 27 new units would ...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Town adds $500,000 to parks fund in $26 mil draft budget</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/town-adds-500-000-to-parks-fund-in-26-mil-draft-budget</link>
     <description>The draft includes an $18.25 million operating budget for day-to-day expenses and a $6.48 million capital-improvement program for infrastructure upgrades.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Town Council requested an additional $500,000 be moved from general reserves to a dedicated parks fund during its June 4 budget review, responding to criticism from parents that the town’s $200,000 allocation for future park amenities was insufficient.</p>
<p>That comes as the town is already including an additional $100,000 for neighborhood park maintenance contracts as part of its $25.97 million draft budget for fiscal 2025-2026, which includes an $18.25 million operating budget for day-to-day expenses and a $6.48 million capital-improvement program for infrastructure upgrades.</p>
<p>“It demonstrates that they are listening to the community and making a serious commitment to improving our parks system,” said Tiburon resident Jenna McKnight, a member of the grassroots Parents for Parks and Rec advocacy group. “While we recognize there are still many steps ahead, tonight’s decision was an important step in the direction of enhancing outdoor life across the generations in Tiburon.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon’s Estuary & Ocean Science Center has been granted a six-month reprieve while San Francisco State University administrators explore an alternative to closing its doors.</p>
<p>The university first announced in February that it would shutter the 53-acre marine biology station due to budget cuts, but that decision has been pushed back until at least January 2026, university officials say, while they discuss long-term options with representatives from an unnamed foundation.</p>
<p>Bobby King, the university’s director of communications, confirmed by email June 5 that options include covering short-term expenses or turning over the facility entirely.</p>
<p>“We would consider the possibility of selling the campus, especially if it allowed the continuation of the kinds of (research) activities currently happening,” he said. “We expect to know more about what’s next at some point in the next six months.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>The principal&apos;s recommendation to suspend the Mosaic Project camp sparked outcry among many parents.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reed Union School District board members have directed Bel Aire Elementary School officials to explore ways to continue the school’s longstanding partnership with The Mosaic Project overnight camp through next year, despite a principal’s recommendation to pause the program.</p>
<p>Principal John DiCosmo had recommended temporarily suspending the four-night diversity camp for fourth graders starting next year. He cited cost concerns, staffing difficulties, safety concerns among some parents, equity issues for students who choose not to participate and questions about how consistently the camp’s lessons were being integrated into classrooms.</p>
<p>The recommendation sparked outcry among many parents who said the experience had been fundamental in their children’s growth.</p>
<p>At the district board’s June 3 meeting, board members directed DiCosmo and district Superintendent Kimberly McGrath to work with representatives from Mosaic to address the district’s concerns and provide an opportunity for students to attend next year while the school continues exploring alternatives.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>The potential potential November 2026 bond measure would pay for facilities upgrades across three campuses.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Reed Union School District will spend up to $25,750 to gauge voter support for a potential November 2026 bond measure that would pay for facilities upgrades across its three campuses.</p>
<p>The district’s board of trustees voted unanimously June 3 to contract with Oakland-based research firm Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz & Associates to conduct the survey. The poll will provide the board with data to help decide whether to seek a bond, in what amount and when to place a measure on the ballot. Survey costs will be paid from the district’s facilities fund, a restricted pot of money kept separate from the general fund that pays for day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz & Associates, or FM3, will work with the district to design and conduct the survey of up to 300 district residents likely to vote in the November 2026 election. The survey would be conducted by telephone and online, with interviews lasting an average of 18 minutes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Video showing new sorted waste bins dumped together sparks backlash online</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/video-showing-new-sorted-waste-bins-dumped-together-sparks-backlash-online</link>
     <description>Mill Valley Refuse Service says the incident was an isolated mistake, but the resident who took the video doesn&apos;t buy it.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video posted online showing a refuse collector emptying downtown Tiburon’s separate trash, recycling and compost bins into a single container has sparked controversy among residents, though contractor Mill Valley Refuse Service says the incident was an isolated mistake.</p>
<p>Posted on Nextdoor June 2 by Belvedere resident Ken Simpson, the video has drawn more than 50 comments, with many questioning whether waste-separation efforts are meaningful.</p>
<p>“Unbelievably repugnant. A complete lack of efficiency on all sides. How many parents have taught our kids to properly sort and save our environment to then see this complete incompetence?” Juliette Decker Rodenbeck of Belvedere posted in reply.</p>
<p>“Thank you for posting this,” wrote Eliza Jewett-Hall of Strawberry. “I’m horrified and disheartened.”</p>
<p>However, Mill Valley Refuse CEO Gene Della Zoppa called the employee’s actions an “isolated incident.” He said the worker noticed contamination in the recycling and compost bins and collected everything as trash with “good intentions.”</p>
<p>“The driver was trying to be helpful,” Della Zoppa said. “However, he didn’t follow proper procedures. We have to have that contamination reported to our office.”</p>
<p>Della Zoppa said the employee was assigned only to collect landfill trash that day, not recyclables and compost, and that the worker has since received additional training.</p>
<p>“Internally, we’ve addressed this and reinforced training and protocol reminders with our team to prevent future issues,” he said.</p>
<p>Della Zoppa added that contamination of recycling and compost bins is common in public locations.</p>
<p>“Unlike residential or commercial bins, public city cans are accessible to everyone — so that includes people out of town,” he said. “So even with the labeling that’s in place, we still see food that’s in the trash bin that’s supposed to be in the compost bin, or we’ll see plastic bottles in the trash. … In general, public city cans are difficult to service. It’s an ongoing challenge.”</p>
<p>Video sparks trash talk</p>
<p>In his initial post on Nextdoor, Simpson suggested his video was evidence of “another recycling scam” and asked, “Who profits from this?”</p>
<p>In follow-up comments, he went on to criticize the waste-management system.</p>
<p>“(The bins) certainly do not do what reasonable people expect. They’re deceiving,” he wrote. “If everything is going to be mixed in the truck and resorted later, then the only reaso...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>In this screengrab from a video posted on Nextdoor by Ken Simpson, a Mill Valley Refuse Service worker is seen dumping presorted trash, recycling and compost bins in downtown Tiburon into the same can before then dumping that can into his truck. The video sparked controversy online, while the company says the worker made a mistake and has been retrained.</media:description>

     <title>Longtime nursery schools leader Marilyn Knight was civic volunteer, helped launch The Ark</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/longtime-nursery-schools-leader-marilyn-knight-was-civic-volunteer-helped-launch-the-ark</link>
     <description>Marilyn Knight died of breast cancer May 24 at her Tiburon home. She was 91.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marilyn Knight, who helped conceive The Ark and served in leadership and consulting roles at the Belvedere-Hawthorne Nursery Schools for more than 35 years, died of breast cancer May 24 at her Tiburon home. She was 91.</p>
<p>Knight spent 18 years as a director at the nursery schools from 1968 to 1986, including the last five years as executive director. She introduced the first pre-kindergarten program in Southern Marin with Hawthorne Pre-K when she first started, said longtime friend and onetime colleague Annelies Atchley of Belvedere. After stepping down as executive director, she continued consulting for the school until 2004. Some of the curriculum she developed is still in use today.</p>
<p>Kathleen Walker Parker, the current head of school and a former executive director at Belvedere-Hawthorne, was hired by Knight in 1984. Parker said the best way to learn in early childhood education is by example, and Knight “did just that.”</p>
<p>“She knew how to lead by example and how to teach best practices with early childhood education,” Parker said. “She was a natural at storytelling and getting down at children’s levels to share.”</p>
<p>Knight was deeply involved in the community beyond her work at the nursery schools, with decades of volunteer work with religious organizations, social services and civic groups.</p>
<p>In 1972, the idea for a new community newspaper emerged at Knight’s Hill Haven home when a group of Tiburon Peninsula residents was making last-minute signs and banners for the Ayala Day picnic at Angel Island. They began venting their frustrations that the existing paper, the Ebb Tide, refused to run a news announcement.</p>
<p>“The idea just popped out. I don’t even remember who said it first,” Knight told The Ark for a 40th anniversary retrospective article in 2013. “We thought, ‘Why couldn’t we just get the group of people together and do it?’ We wanted a paper of the people and by the people and for the community.”</p>
<p>Knight became the first subscriber when the first of two 1972 sample editions was laid out on her and late husband Jeff’s kitchen table ahead of The Ark’s first formal issue Jan. 10, 1973.</p>
<p>Knight was born Marilyn Valerie Sanchez-Corea on Oct. 6, 1933, in San Francisco to dental surgeon Antonio Sanchez-Corea and teacher Helen McCarty. Her father was born in Guatemala and moved to the U.S. at age 10, later bringing his dental practice to Tiburon about 1960. Her mother was raised in San Francisco and was of Ir...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-tiburon-mom-reflects-on-global-path-to-local-life</link>
     <description>Born in South Africa, Jennifer Freker moved to London at age 9 before studying psychology and art history at college — “uni,” she says — in Scotland, where she met her American husband.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disney likes to fetch tennis balls. The only problem is, she won’t let you pick them up.</p>
<p>Tiburon resident Jennifer Freker laughs as she wrestles a ball from the 5-year-old dog during a walk at Belvedere Community Park on June 4. For Freker, 38, it’s a typical day as a stay-at-home mother who often walks Disney before picking up her youngest from nursery school.</p>
<p>With her kids at ages 8, 6 and 3, “I think I’m through the darkest days,” she says, “at least until the teenage years.”</p>
<p>But Freker’s path to this moment began on another continent entirely.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Reed district to revamp free meals with healthier and better-tasting food</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-district-to-revamp-free-meals-with-healthier-and-better-tasting-food</link>
     <description>Officials noted complaints about both the overall quality of the food and the amount of waste in much of the packaging.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Reed Union School District is revamping its free breakfast and lunch program for the 2025-2026 school year in hopes of providing healthier, better-tasting meals to its students.</p>
<p>The district has ended its contract with current food vendor, San Carlos-based The LunchMaster, and will instead contract with local catering company Dee’s Organics, which operates out of Kentfield, to run its on-campus meal program. The district’s board of directors voted unanimously at its June 3 meeting to approve the estimated $715,646 contract with Dee’s Organics to provide some 132,271 lunches and 100,553 breakfasts between August and June.</p>
<p>That accounts for not only the Reed students expected to take advantage of the meal program but also covers breakfast and lunch distribution in the Ross and Kentfield school districts, which go through the Reed district to obtain their meals. The free meal program is fully funded through state and federal reimbursements.</p>]]></content:encoded>
