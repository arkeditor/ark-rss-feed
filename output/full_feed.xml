     <title>Strawberry swimmer circles Lake Tahoe as training for 840-mile California coast swim</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-swimmer-circles-lake-tahoe-as-training-for-840-mile-california-coast-swim</link>
     <description>Covering 60 miles in six days, Catherine Breed is believed to be the first to follow the full Lake Tahoe Water Trail.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Catherine Breed graduated in 2015 from the University of California at Berkeley, where she cemented herself in the Golden Bears’ swim history books, she knew she wanted to continue in the sport, but she didn’t want to race.</p>
<p>Her love of ocean swims, which she’d complete as practice while at Cal, eventually led her to San Francisco’s Dolphin Club, known for its open-water swimming. Members there suggested to her that because “you’re pretty fast and you’re not intimidated by the cold and the current and the waves, you should try the English Channel.”</p>
<p>“That’s crazy,” the Strawberry resident recalls of her initial response. “Why would anyone swim 21 miles?”</p>
<p>Breed, 32, has since built a name for herself as an endurance and long-distance swimmer, taking on the English Channel, Monterey Bay, Catalina Channel and the Cook Strait, which separates New Zealand’s North and South islands.</p>
<p>More recently, she swam the roughly 60-mile circumference of Lake Tahoe, following the length of the Lake Tahoe Water Trail from July 16 to 21. While others have swam the lake’s circumference, Breed is believed to be the first swimmer to take on the trail over consecutive days as training for her planned endeavor to swim the roughly 840 miles of California’s coast, from its border with Oregon to the international border with Mexico.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon adds EV-readiness, stricter energy rules for more home projects</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-adds-ev-readiness-stricter-energy-rules-for-more-home-projects</link>
     <description>Tiburon will require EV-charging readiness and stricter energy-efficiency standards for more home projects starting in 2026.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon homeowners planning construction and renovations will face new requirements for electric-vehicle charging readiness and stricter energy-efficiency standards starting next year.</p>
<p>The new EV-readiness rule will apply to new construction and to upgrades involving main service panels at both single-family and multifamily residences. The energy-efficiency reach code, which “reaches” beyond state minimum requirements, will expand requirements to additions and alterations equaling or exceeding 500 square feet in single-family homes, down from the previous 750-square-foot threshold.</p>
<p>Those standards, called the “Flex Path,” require projects to meet a target energy score of six points, with certain actions worth specific points values: having air sealing and water-heating packages are each worth one point, while a high-efficiency heat-pump water heater is worth 13 points. Additionally, all exterior lights must have LED light bulbs and photocell controls. Accessory dwelling units and junior units, mobile homes or manufactured homes and owners enrolled in a cost-saving program are exempt from the requirements.</p>
<p>Enforcement of new provisions begins Jan. 1, 2026, after the Town Council at its Aug. 6 meeting unanimously approved the first reading to implement the changes. The council will conduct a second, required vote at its Aug. 20 meeting, and the ordinance will take effect 30 days later.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon council OKs $600k grant toward addressing sea rise</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/town-council-oks-600k-grant-toward-addressing-sea-rise</link>
     <description>Tiburon receives nearly $600K in state funds to create a sea-level rise vulnerability assessment and adaptation plan.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon has secured nearly $600,000 in state funding to help meet mandates requiring the town to address rising sea levels threatening its shorelines.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously Aug. 6 to accept a $593,877 grant from the California Ocean Protection Council. The funding will allow the town to hire a consultant to help create a sea-level rise vulnerability assessment and adaptation plan.</p>
<p>All coastal jurisdictions are required to adopt a Subregional Shoreline Adaptation Plan by 2034 under Senate Bill 272.</p>
<p>Grace Ledwith, the town’s climate action and sustainability coordinator, said the grant “is incredibly important” to help address sea-level rise.</p>
<p>“It allows us to dedicate resources to better understand the specific vulnerabilities facing Tiburon’s assets, ecosystems, local services or the people who live and work here,” she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>New leadership drives Tiburon Fire’s overhaul of strategic planning</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/new-leadership-drives-tiburon-fire-s-overhaul-of-strategic-planning</link>
     <description>Tiburon Fire will spend $49,875 on its first strategic plan in 15 years to guide operations and leadership changes.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Fire Protection District will spend $49,875 on its first strategic plan in 15 years as new leadership seeks to chart the agency’s direction amid a period of transition.</p>
<p>The board approved the contract with Fairfax-based consultant The People Piece in a 3-0 vote at its June 24 meeting, with members Joy Ho and Cheryl Woodford absent. Fire Chief Tommy Hellyer, who took over leadership in February after Chief Richard Pearce’s retirement, said the five-year plan should be completed by year’s end.</p>
<p>Hellyer selected The People Piece from three consulting firms after interviews and bid comparisons. Its Fairfax location offers “added accessibility and an understanding of our regional context,” he said, along with competitive pricing and organizational fit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon council advances updates for faster lot splits, duplex approvals</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-council-advances-updates-for-faster-lot-splits-duplex-approvals</link>
     <description>Tiburon updates housing rules to match new state law easing duplex, lot-split approvals in single-family neighborhoods.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will update local housing regulations to align them with recent changes to state law that streamline density increases in single-family neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously Aug. 6 to approve amendments to municipal code governing urban lot splits and two-unit housing developments. The ordinances will return for final adoption at the council’s Aug. 20 meeting and take effect 30 days later.</p>
<p>The changes will bring Tiburon into compliance with Senate Bill 450, which took effect Jan. 1 and modifies SB 9, California’s 2021 legislation allowing single-family homes to be converted into duplexes and residential parcels to be split into two lots without discretionary review.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon artist laureate aims to bridge community, environment</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-artist-laureate-aims-to-bridge-community-environment</link>
     <description>Christa Grenawalt begins a four-year term as the town&apos;s newest cultural ambassador.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artist Christa Grenawalt says she draws much of her inspiration from immersing herself in her surroundings.</p>
<p>Whether she’s plein air painting on the beaches of the Hawaiian isle of Kauai or more locally at Ring Mountain, Mount Tiburon or Old St. Hilary’s Open Space Preserve, she says she values “dropping in and paying attention to things that might normally be unnoticed in our environment and in nature.”</p>
<p>As an artist, she says, she not only wants to engage with her environment but with the larger community — and she’ll have the chance to do just that over the next four years as Tiburon’s artist laureate. She was appointed to the position by a unanimous vote of the council at its Aug. 6 meeting, replacing Richard Rozen, whose term ended in May 2022. Rozen crowned Grenawalt with a laurel wreath at the meeting to mark the handoff.</p>
<p>Grenawalt, 51, said she was looking into fostering creativity, nature and community, listing outdoor installations and participatory art as potential public projects to explore during her term, during which she noted she hopes to help locals “see themselves as part of a living artwork rooted in place and history and in a shared hope.”</p>
<p>“I believe that art can act as a bridge, and in this role, I’m hoping to use it to create connection between generations and across the communities here,” she told councilmembers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Powwow dances, storytelling, native foods set for Tiburon’s first Native American heritage celebration Aug. 17 at Zelinsky Park.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arts and crafts, storytelling and a live dance performance from an internationally touring group are planned for Tiburon’s inaugural celebration of Native American culture and heritage, set for 1-4 p.m. Aug. 17 at Zelinsky Park.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to work with members of the American Indian community in Tiburon and Marin County to highlight the richness of contemporary Native American culture here in town,” said Heritage and Arts Commission Chair Arjun Gupta. The commission is co-organizing the free event, which also received financial support from Tiburon’s Diversity Inclusion Task Force.</p>
<p>A highlight of the afternoon will be “powwow-style dances” performed by Sewam American Indian Dance. Tiburon resident and event co-organizer Eddie Madril, who co-directs the troupe with his wife, Sara Moncada, said the group will also educate attendees on origins of the dances performed and of regalia worn, and their performances will include audience participation for all ages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon officials back flood study for Greenwood Cove Drive</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-officials-back-flood-study-for-greenwood-cove-drive</link>
     <description>$200k proposal aims to ease chronic road problems tied to tides and runoff</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon officials have backed spending an initial $200,000 to find easy fixes for frequent flooding along a stretch of Greenwood Cove Drive that sometimes spills over onto Tiburon Boulevard.</p>
<p>The Marin Flood Control Zone 4 advisory board voted 3-0 at its July 22 meeting to direct county staff to send out requests for proposals to evaluate the area’s tidal flooding and stormwater drainage, particularly drainage from Upper Cecilia Way into East Creek. Member Liza Gregory Bass was absent, and the advisory board has one vacancy.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a very worthwhile investment,” said member Sheldon Dorph, who sits on a subcommittee that determined the scope of the study. He said the study would eventually help “so that I don’t need a boat to get out of my house, but I can still take the car.”</p>
<p>The Greenwood Cove Drive-Tiburon Boulevard corridor, which has segments in both incorporated and unincorporated Tiburon, has been known to flood following seasonal king tides. The flooding is magnified during substantial rainfall, sometimes causing the water to make its way to inbound Tiburon Boulevard, as it did last December, causing ankle-high flooding on Greenwood Cove and submerging an inbound lane on the boulevard next to the 76 gas station and the Marin Transit bus stop.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Revisions were expected as routine back-and-forth process enters next phase</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Mallard Pointe housing development faces construction delays until at least next spring after Belvedere officials found the developer failed to provide relocation benefits to displaced tenants and submitted incomplete permit applications missing dozens of required approvals.</p>
<p>The 40-unit lagoon-front project across from City Hall would demolish 22 existing rental units and build 40 new units at 1-22 Mallard Road. Belvedere on July 22 sent Thompson Dorfman LLC, a partner in owner Mallard Pointe 1951 LLC, incompleteness notices regarding the initial demolition and infrastructure plans submitted between October and April and bulkhead-replacement plans submitted in January and February, along with a compliance inquiry letter submitted June 18.</p>
<p>Principal Bruce Dorfman said he plans to submit revisions in the coming weeks and hopes to begin work next spring. He and Planning Director Rebecca Markwick both noted the process is routine, with Dorfman saying this kicks off what likely will be several iterations back and forth in a process that could last through the end of the year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/garden-plot-hydrangeas-sport-plentiful-summer-blooms</link>
     <description>Hydrangeas thrive in summer — columnist Diane Lynch shares growing tips, drying advice and favorite cultivars for local gardens.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hydrangeas are one of the most luscious flowering plants you can grow. They set blooms in late spring, and summer is their heyday. As the blooms open, there will be a huge mound of bright green foliage dotted with gigantic flowers. At peak bloom, a single flower can make a bouquet by itself.</p>
<p>Hydrangeas like shade as a rule, but in our cool climate can tolerate a little sun, though midday sun can scorch the leaves. I was talking to a rose grower in Sonoma who also grew hydrangeas for sale. He told me that hydrangeas like shade but also want to see the sky. I have one in my lower garden that’s under a plum tree, and it blooms very late because it cannot see the sky.</p>
<p>If you want to dry them for extended enjoyment, now through late summer is the time to do so. You want to dry them when in full bloom and not yet faded. You can hang them upside down in a closet or shady place outdoors to dry. Or simply letting the water evaporate from a vase will often result in a nicely dried specimen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon resident wins best scone at fair</title>

     <description>Paradise Cay’s Kim Gormley wins Marin Fair scone crown with lemon zest recipe; her vegan zucchini bread takes second in breads.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paradise Cay resident Kim Gormley says she’s drawn to baking because it feels more joyful than cooking.</p>
<p>“Cooking, often, is just the daily meal, and for me, it gets a little routine,” she says. “But baking is sort of a special treat a lot of the times, and I like that part about it.”</p>
<p>For Gormley, baking is often celebratory — and her baked goods are also to be celebrated, according to a panel of judges at this year’s Marin County Fair. Gormley’s lemon scones earned first place among all scones at the fair, held July 2-6, while her vegan zucchini bread won second place among all breads.</p>
<p>This year’s wins come after Gormley earned a third-place finish in 2019 for a blueberry cobbler.</p>
<p>“I know it’s very competitive at that exhibit,” Gormley, 59, says. “And to see that the judges felt that my entry was up there with the other entrants, it really made me happy and proud.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Transportation study flags Tiburon, Belvedere among 19 areas at risk from sea rise</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/transportation-study-flags-tiburon-belvedere-among-19-areas-at-risk-from-sea-rise</link>
     <description>Sea-level rise study highlights Tiburon, Belvedere risks; town to vote on funding to launch adaptation plan under SB 272</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will take its first steps toward meeting state mandates to address sea-level rise following a study that identified both Belvedere and Tiburon among 19 vulnerable areas across Marin County.</p>
<p>Grace Ledwith, Tiburon’s climate action and sustainability coordinator, and Councilmember Alice Fredericks said the Town Council will vote tonight, Aug. 6, to accept a $593,877 grant from the California Ocean Protection Council. The grant will help the town meet mandates set by Senate Bill 272, which requires all coastal jurisdictions to develop and adopt Subregional Shoreline Adaptation Plans by 2034.</p>
<p>Tiburon’s planned vote follows the Transportation Authority of Marin board’s 12-0 decision June 26 to accept its sea-level rise study, which aims to address “critical challenges posed by rising sea levels and coastal flooding to Marin County’s transportation infrastructure.” Fredericks and Belvedere Councilmember Pat Carapiet both sit on the transportation authority board.</p>
<p>The study includes a voluntary adaptation policy that could provide additional funding to Tiburon and Belvedere. Jurisdictions that adopt the policy and align their sea-level rise goals with the transportation authority’s plan would gain access to Measure AA sales-tax funds for adaptation support, along with project development assistance, grant writing support and technical assistance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Russia quake triggered 19-hour tsunami advisory; local surge fizzled</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/russia-quake-triggered-19-hour-tsunami-advisory-local-surge-fizzled</link>
     <description>Tiburon Peninsula officials rely on AlertMarin, but just 34% in 94920 are signed up</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Peninsula was under a tsunami alert for nearly 19 hours last week after an 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia’s coast triggered the strongest global tsunami-alert system activation in more than a decade.</p>
<p>No local evacuations were ordered, and no injuries or damage was reported.</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, first issued a tsunami watch July 29, the lowest-level alert, for the U.S. West Coast shortly after the quake struck at 4:25 p.m. Pacific. That was upgraded to an advisory at 6:30 p.m., with the initial surge predicted to hit San Francisco at 12:40 a.m. July 30.</p>
<p>“Stay away from the water! Stay away from beaches and waterways! Remain away from shore until local officials say that it is OK to return,” the National Weather Service Bay Area warned on social media.</p>
<p>Those warnings are standard under a second-tier tsunami advisory, which is issued when the surge is expected to produce strong currents and waves capable of flooding beaches and harbor areas but without widespread coastal inundation. A tsunami warning — like the one briefly issued on the Tiburon Peninsula after December’s 7.0-magnitude quake off Humboldt County — is more severe, signaling a dangerous surge likely to cause major flooding and prompting evacuation of at-risk zones.</p>
<p>By Ark estimates, roughly 1,000 homes, businesses and public facilities sit in Tiburon’s and Belvedere’s combined tsunami inundation zones as mapped by the California Geological Survey, though that’s for an extreme event — a 9.3 Alaskan quake that would send a 13-foot wall of water to the peninsula.</p>
<p>When the tsunami arrived in San Francisco Bay at 1:12 a.m. July 30, initial surges were less than one foot atop normal tides and storm surges. Within hours, the bay experienced tidal swings of 2 to 5 feet within 15-minute periods, creating dangerous currents, according to the weather service.</p>
<p>While tsunami wave heights may seem modest, they travel at jet-plane speeds across deep ocean waters before slowing to 20-30 mph near shore, creating rapidly rising surges that appear as fast-moving floods rather than breaking waves.</p>
<p>Point Reyes recorded the highest tidal deviation in Marin, nearly 2 feet at 4 a.m., more than three hours after the initial surge arrived, the weather service reported. The regional alert was canceled about 11 a.m. July 30, though water levels continued to fluctuate...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>Last week’s 8.8 earthquake in Russia initially triggered a tsunami watch on the West Coast, indicating a tsunami was possible and to be prepared. That was later elevated to a tsunami advisory, which means a tsunami is expected to strike and could cause dangerous currents and waves, potentially flooding beaches and harbors. People are advised to keep their distance. (via NOAA)</media:description>
