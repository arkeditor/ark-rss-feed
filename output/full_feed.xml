      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reed Union School District teachers are set to receive an 8.15% salary boost over the next two school years — though the president of the teachers’ union says the increase still falls short of what’s needed to keep pace with the high cost of living in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, reached after several months of negotiations between the district and the Reed District Teachers Association, certificated teachers will receive a 5% raise for the 2025-2026 school year, effective July 1.</p>
<p>That will be followed by a 3% increase for the 2026-2027 school year, effective July 1, 2026.</p>
<p>The contract was unanimously approved by the district’s board of trustees on May 13.</p>
<p>“The agreed-upon salary increases reflect the district’s deep commitment to attracting and retaining the best educators, recognizing their immense value, while also ensuring we are responsible stewards of our financial resources to best serve our students and community,” Superintendent Kimberly McGrath said.</p>
<p>However, Reed District Teachers Association President Shea O’Brien, a science teacher at Del Mar Middle School, said that while the union was glad to have reached an agreement, “we believe the contract still falls short of ensuring housing security for all teachers in the Reed Union School District.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Belvedere to ban throttle e-bikes for kids</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-to-ban-throttle-e-bikes-for-kids</link>
      <description>The city will join Tiburon and other Marin municipalities in a countywide pilot program meant to make trails and roads safer for all riders.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere will ban riders under age 16 from using throttle-assisted e-bikes starting in July, joining Tiburon and other Marin municipalities in a countywide pilot program meant to make trails and roads safer for all riders.</p>
<p>The City Council voted unanimously May 12 to establish an ordinance with the age restriction and a rule requiring all legal riders of throttle-assisted bikes to wear helmets. Councilmembers will conduct their second, required vote for adoption at their June 9 meeting.</p>
<p>“I’m really pleased that Belvedere’s joining the rest of the county in this effort,” Mayor Jane Cooper said. “It’s, I think, keeping children safe and keeping community members safe. We’ve heard a lot about it from the community and the concern with the e-bike riders being a little bit wild.”</p>
<p>The county-specific pilot program runs through 2029 under Assembly Bill 1778, authored by Assemblymember Damon Connolly, D-San Rafael, and signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom last year.</p>
<p>The Marin Board of Supervisors in March voted to implement the same age-restriction and helmet rules on throttle-assisted Class 2 e-bikes — which can reach speeds of 20 mph without pedaling, though easily accessible hacks allow them to travel significantly faster — in unincorporated areas, including Strawberry and Paradise Cay.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>City joins campaign against boulevard bike lanes</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/city-joins-campaign-against-boulevard-bike-lanes</link>
      <description>Belvedere is again raising safety concerns, this time taking its appeal directly to the state.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belvedere City Council is again raising safety concerns about Caltrans’ plans to add bike lanes along Tiburon Boulevard as part of a wider repaving project next year — this time taking its appeal directly to the state.</p>
<p>But Caltrans’ officials have made it clear: “The bike lanes will stay.”</p>
<p>In Belvedere’s latest letter, to Caltrans Bay Area district chief Dina El-Tawansy, Mayor Jane Cooper and City Manager Robert Zadnik cited “safety hazards” from “unprotected bike lanes,” particularly near Reed Ranch Road, Blackie’s Pasture and the Highway 101 interchange. The letter also cited impacts to Marin Transit bus stops, likely loss of school-bus stops between Blackfield Drive and Trestle Glen Boulevard, emergency-response risks and “increased congestion and commuter disruption.”</p>
<p>“The pace and lack of transparency have blindsided key stakeholders and left critical concerns unresolved,” it says. “We also question whether early letters of support from county and state officials were based on a complete understanding of the project’s real-world impacts — and whether that support still stands in light of current agency and community objections.”</p>
<p>The $23 million project’s design is 95% complete as of Feb. 28, with finalization expected by mid-summer, when it will go out to bid. Construction is planned to begin in winter 2026 and last one year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <media:description>Caltrans plans to create bikeways on the north and south sides of Tiburon Boulevard as part of its 2026 repaving and rehabilitation project that extends from Mill Valley to downtown Paradise Drive. The blue segments represent Class-2 bike lanes, or marked on-road lanes alongside traffic that don’t have a physical barrier; the red segments are Class-4 separated bikeways, which are also on the roadway but protected from traffic; and the gold segment is a Class-1 bike path, which is away from the road, like the Old Rail Trail.

      <title>Belvedere’s $14.2M draft budget prioritizes Beach Road seawall</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-s-14-2m-draft-budget-prioritizes-beach-road-seawall</link>
      <description>The city is expected to spend $2.66 million to stabilize the seawall while also allocating more toward legal expenses amid ongoing lawsuits.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere is expected to spend $2.66 million in the upcoming fiscal year to stabilize the Beach Road seawall and levee while also allocating more toward legal expenses amid ongoing lawsuits challenging the city’s construction-time-limit fines.</p>
<p>Driven by the Beach Road project, the draft budget for fiscal year 2025-2026, which begins July 1, anticipates $14.22 million in expenditures against $11.38 million in revenue, leaving a deficit of $2.84 million that will be covered by withdrawals from the city’s general and critical-infrastructure funds.</p>
<p>Despite the deficit, Administrative Services Director Helga Cotter said the city will still meet its general-fund reserve goal of at least 50% of expected expenditures plus the cost of fire and pension-debt services for fiscal 2026 and the four subsequent fiscal years. Belvedere is expected to finish fiscal 2026 in June with a 51% reserve, or $4.62 million where $4.58 million is required.</p>
<p>The draft budget was presented at the City Council’s May 12 meeting, with a council vote to formally adopt the budget expected June 9.</p>
<p>Operating expenditures of $10.1 million are up 11.3% from the current year, with nearly three-quarters related to personnel and the city’s $2.49-million fire-protection contract with the Tiburon Fire Protection District. Operating revenues of $10.81 million will create a $712,193 surplus for fiscal 2026 when excluding capital projects.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Medical drama hits home for ER chief shaped by Columbine and Aurora tragedies</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/medical-drama-hits-home-for-er-chief-shaped-by-columbine-and-aurora-tragedies</link>
      <description>Tiburon's Christopher Colwell is chief of emergency medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Christopher Colwell, watching an episode of “The Pitt” isn’t just entertainment — it’s a reflection of his reality. The medical drama streaming on Max takes place inside an overcrowded, underfunded emergency room, and it features real cases, he says, even if there’s some added theatrics.</p>
<p>“What ‘The Pitt’ does is the closest thing to what I do that I’ve ever seen,” says the 59-year-old Tiburon resident, who serves as chief of emergency medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center.</p>
<p>Colwell speaks from extensive experience. Before moving to the Bay Area in 2016, he served as emergency-medicine director at Denver Health hospital from 2010 to 2016, where he earlier worked as medical director for both the Denver Fire Department and Denver Health’s paramedic division.</p>
<p>It was during his Denver tenure that Colwell responded to the 1999 Columbine High School massacre that left 14 dead and the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, movie-theater shooting that killed 13. He was in San Francisco for the 2017 UPS-facility shooting where three died.</p>
<p>His expertise from these tragedies informs his work overseeing an emergency department that treats 76,000 patients a year and has shaped him into an authoritative voice on disaster management, mass-casualty events, COVID-19 responses and wildfire health impacts. He’s sought out to speak at medical conferences, as an expert voice in the press and even to review TV shows for medical accuracy, as he did for “The Pitt” in online magazine Slate in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <media:description>Tiburon resident Christopher Colwell is the chief of the emergency-medicine department at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, a position he’s held since 2016. Prior to that, he spent nearly 20 years at Denver Health, including six years as emergency-medicine chief from 2010 to 2016. At Denver Health, he was on the scene during the 1999 Columbine High School shooting and led the response to the 2012 Aurora movie theater killings. He’s become a leader in discussing how to handle mass-casualty events from a medical standpoint, talking at conferences and to news outlets. (Francisco Martinez / The Ark)</media:description>

      <title>Tiburon resident trades tech career for Detroit-style pizza</title>

      <description>Tiburon resident Joe Garfola is now serving up Motor City-style pies as the owner of Squared Pizza at the Bon Aire Center.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As much as Tiburon resident Joe Garfola enjoys pizza, he says he’d get a little homesick whenever he and his family would order a circular pie.</p>
<p>Garfola is from Detroit, where square pizza reigns supreme. He says he noticed there was a dearth of options in Marin County that served it up — so he decided to fill the gap.</p>
<p>“We wanted to have the opportunity to provide it for others, of course, but also have the pizza that we’d like to eat,” he says.</p>
<p>Garfola is now serving up Motor City-style pies as the owner of Squared Pizza at the Bon Aire Center in Greenbrae. After a soft launch in late March, the restaurant had its grand opening May 3.</p>
<p>The shop offers all the classic pizza toppings, from pepperoni and sausage to onions, olives, jalapeños and mushrooms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Officials emphasize emergency preparation during resident chat</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/officials-emphasize-emergency-preparation-during-resident-chat</link>
      <description>“Our goal is to take little baby steps in emergency preparedness to get everybody involved and understand what takes place in being prepared."</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere officials are reminding residents to prioritize emergency preparedness, including having three days’ worth of supplies ready in case of a disaster and making sure they sign up for alerts to receive timely information from authorities.</p>
<p>City Manager Robert Zadnik and Councilmember Pat Carapiet discussed Belvedere’s emergency-prep efforts at an informal April 30 community chat attended by more than 20 residents at Larry Binkley and Kathy Huber’s West Shore Road home.</p>
<p>Carapiet said emergency preparedness has been at the forefront of everyone’s mind following the Los Angeles wildfires in January, which burned more than 50,000 acres and destroyed more than 16,000 homes and commercial properties across Pacific Palisades, Malibu and Altadena.</p>
<p>The April 30 chat followed a Feb. 25 Tiburon Peninsula-wide community forum on fire safety hosted by Tiburon Mayor Holli Thier and Belvedere Mayor Jane Cooper.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to take little baby steps in emergency preparedness to get everybody involved and understand what takes place in being prepared,” Carapiet said, adding that conversations with Belvedere Police Chief Jason Wu, the Tiburon Fire Protection District and Marin emergency-preparedness organizations have prompted one top goal for residents: “You yourself have to be prepared.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>In addition to teaching music classes, Carolyn Balfe also leads a lunchtime chorus for second graders and another second-grade club called Community Time Leaders.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reed Elementary School music teacher Carolyn Balfe has been named the Rotary Club of Tiburon-Belvedere’s educator of the year, recognizing her standout efforts to engage students and the enthusiasm she brings to the school community.</p>
<p>Balfe was honored by Rotary May 7 at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library, where she received $600 from the club.</p>
<p>The Educator of the Year honors are typically given out annually to at least one teacher each within the Reed Union School District and at St. Hilary School who are chosen by their peers. Rotary Club Public Image Chair Judy Wilson said St. Hilary School had not selected its honoree by the May 7 ceremony and that the club would work with the school to honor its chosen educator later.</p>
<p>Balfe called the recognition “a happy surprise,” adding that “my job sparks joy in others and it brings me joy, so it’s a win-win.”</p>
<p>She’s in her 10th year teaching at Reed school and her 26th overall. In addition to teaching music classes, she also leads a lunchtime chorus for second graders and another second-grade club called Community Time Leaders, who help lead the school’s weekly assemblies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/rare-waterfront-eichler-on-west-shore-road-hits-market-for-11-58-million</link>
      <description>Interior designer Pam Robertson and her husband, Jim, have owned the home for 26 years and still have the original design plans.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A waterfront mid-century modern Belvedere home designed by architect A. Quincy Jones and built by pioneering developer Joseph Eichler is on the market for $11.58 million.</p>
<p>The 2,190-square-foot four-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom home at 27 West Shore Road features an open floor plan covering the living room, dining area, sitting area and kitchen. There’s also a 430-square-foot two-car garage and an outdoor space with a lawn, deck, fire pit, spa and boat dock situated on Richardson Bay, with views of Sausalito and the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
<p>Shana Rohde-Lynch, the Tiburon Peninsula real-estate agent listing the property, said the home represents California, calling it unique because it feels like a Malibu beach house seated on Richardson Bay.</p>
<p>“To actually go through that living space on the bay and see the Golden Gate Bridge and all of Sausalito is very unique — and with your own private boat dock,” Rohde-Lynch said. “It doesn’t get much better than that for California living.”</p>
<p>While Eichler homes are in Marin, they’re mainly in northern San Rafael, Rohde-Lynch said, “so it’s rare to see them on the water.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>She recalls her first taste of japchae, a sweet-potato noodle dish with vegetables and sauce that she encountered while studying at Yale University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>What she enjoyed about the dish, Bermingham says during a May 7 visit to the Belvedere-Tiburon Library, was the blend of sweetness with the vegetables, as well as it being a new flavor, and “the care with which the person who had the food truck … made it available to us.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than three dozen artists will display 50 works inspired by authors, novels and literary passages in “Art Inspired by Literature” at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library.</p>
<p>The exhibit runs May 15-July 10, with an artists’ reception from 6 to 8 p.m. on opening night. The reception includes a youth-focused event, “Turning Stories into Art,” with a supervised story time and crafts in the Children’s Room from 6 to 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Tiburon’s Julia Baker is exhibiting “A Letter to an American Woman Who Wants to Learn French,” a painting inspired by a magazine passage that echoed her French great-grandmother’s journey to America in the late 1800s.</p>
<p>When Baker’s mother was reorganizing the family home, she found a box filled with old letters, photos and all kinds of documents left by her ancestor. Baker is now using the old ephemera in her mixed-media work. These include a vintage envelope addressed to her grandmother, a faded photograph of her great-grandmother sitting on the lawn and the front of a letter the woman wrote in French, now barely visible.</p>
<p>“For me, this painting is a meditation on memory, migration and the way language both connects and obscures,” Baker says. “It’s a visual letter back through time, an imagined response to a real woman who already knew the language of the heart. I used the magazine page as an image transfer, so the title and article read backward — a visual echo of how stories shift overtime, especially across languages and generations.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Garden Plot: Think carefully about how to conserve water</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/garden-plot-think-carefully-about-how-to-conserve-water</link>
      <description>No rain means no option except to turn on the spigot, unless you were smart — or hardworking — enough to have set up a system of capturing water from your downspouts.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re entering our annual drought season. You can count on no rain of any consequence from May until October or November at the earliest. This leaves us with no option except to turn on the spigot, unless you were smart — or hardworking — enough to have set up a system of capturing water from your downspouts. This would be something to plan now for next winter’s rains. Most of Marin’s water comes from the Mount Tamalpais watershed, which feeds five of the seven reservoirs in the county. About 75% of the county’s water supply is stored in these reservoirs, and the remainder comes from the Russian River.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Agency pulls two tons of debris from Richardson Bay</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/agency-pulls-two-tons-of-debris-from-richardson-bay</link>
      <description>The cleanup is in support of a plan to revitalize ecologically vital eelgrass beds damaged by long-term anchoring.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two small boats, a shopping cart, a PlayStation, outboard engines, portable generators, a baseball bat, an office chair, a floor lamp, an electric keyboard, multiple anchors and a microwave.</p>
<p>Those items were among the more than two tons of debris scuba divers working for the Richardson Bay Regional Agency pulled up from the bay floor last month during a weeklong cleanup of the newly established eelgrass protection zone, according to officials.</p>
<p>The cleanup is in support of a plan to revitalize ecologically vital eelgrass beds damaged by long-term anchoring on Richardson Bay. Last October, the agency officially declared a 300-acre portion of the bay off limits to anchoring and has committed to restoring 15 acres of eelgrass by 2027.</p>
<p>The April cleanup targeted only one acre of bay floor, but future cleanups are planned for later in May and in the summer, officials said.</p>
<p>“Sadly, I’m not surprised at the amount of debris and discarded items we removed from the bay floor,” regional agency Executive Director Brad Gross said in a prepared statement. “We are not accusing anyone of deliberately discarding items overboard. That said, the type and amount of debris littering the bay floor … reinforces the fact that an environmentally sensitive area like Richardson Bay is no place for mariners to permanently reside on vessels at anchor.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>‘Utter disgrace’: Peninsula residents vent over latest power failure</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/utter-disgrace-peninsula-residents-vent-over-latest-power-failure</link>
      <description>A fallen tree in Strawberry knocked out power to more than 4,000 Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers across the Tiburon Peninsula.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fallen tree in Strawberry knocked out power to more than 4,000 Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers across the Tiburon Peninsula May 6-7, leaving residents frustrated with what they describe as deteriorating service despite rising utility bills.</p>
<p>Customers across all of Belvedere, segments of Strawberry, Greenwood Cove Drive, Greenwood Beach Road, and the Old Tiburon, downtown Tiburon, Round Hill, Del Mar and Hawthorne Terrace neighborhoods lost power beginning about 8:50 p.m., according to PG&E’s online outage tracker. Most of the peninsula had power restored by 11:43 p.m., nearly three hours after the outage was first logged, though several reported power fluctuations throughout the evening.</p>
<p>Some 486 customers near 45 Reed Blvd., where the tree fell onto the power line, didn’t see their electricity restored until about 6:45 a.m. May 7, nearly 10 hours after the outage began, according to PG&E incident reports.</p>
<p>“What is going on with back-to-back power cuts in Belvedere and Tiburon?” Round Hill resident Annie Joseph posted on community forum Nextdoor, later adding: “The infrastructure is an utter disgrace.”</p>
<p>The social media platform filled with complaints from residents, including some who missed the Golden State Warriors’ playoff victory that evening because of the blackout.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <media:description>Tiburon resident Ray Lynch drops off vegetation cuttings he collected from around the neighborhood at Blackie’s Pasture on May 10 for the first free Chipper Day of the year. Hosted by the Tiburon Fire Protection District and Tiburon Department of Public Works, residents can drop off cuttings and tree stumps for free to help protect the community against wildfires. Staff and volunteers who collected the vegetation with tractors and piled it into containers estimated a total of 400 cubic yards would be collected by the end of the day, one of the highest volumes in recent years. The event runs 9 a.m.-4 p.m. on second Saturdays through September, with the next on June 14. (Leo Leung / For The Ark)</media:description>

      <description>Ann T. Morrison died peacefully on May 5, 2025.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ann T. Morrison died peacefully on May 5, 2025. Her poetic last words were, “I’m ready to get on the airplane now.” Born in Evanston, IL, and only child of Eleanor and Joseph Morrison, she grew up in Pasadena, CA, where she attended Poly and West Ridge schools, and graduated from San Francisco State University with a degree in English. She moved to Belvedere in 1955. Ann taught elementary school in Marin at Bel Aire, Marin Country Day, and Wade Thomas schools. She held numerous volunteer jobs, including helping Judge David Baty develop a docent program in the courts for students. She also served on the board of the Belvedere Tennis Club, and as a member of the Alliance to Save Our Hospital. She loved the old days of photography doing her own developing and printing. Her passion was cruising on the small ships of The Seabourn and The Silver Seas. Her favorite place of all to be was her apartment over the water in Belvedere Cove where she lived for an amazing 51 years. She is survived by East Coast relatives the Andersons and the Mahoneys. She also enjoyed wonderful years of friendship with Erica McAuliffe and Nathan Good. She would like if everyone who reads this shares a fun surprise or little gift with a friend. She was 89 years old and will be missed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Town Hall exhibit highlights artists with indigenous roots</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/town-hall-exhibit-highlights-artists-with-indigenous-roots</link>
      <description>The show, “We Know Who We Are,” will have an artists’ reception 6-8 p.m. May 13.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From left, ‘The Healing’ by Henry Frank,‘Potato Famine Si! Tortillas No’ by Marty Meadeand ‘Walk’n My Talk’ by Alicia Retes are part of the ‘We Know Who We Are’ exhibit at Tiburon Town Hall featuring artists with indigenous roots.</p>
<p>Indigenous artists from around the Bay Area have their works on display in “We Know Who We Are,” showing at Tiburon Town Hall through June 24.</p>
<p>The show, which will have an artists’ reception 6-8 p.m. May 13, is part of an ongoing effort by the Tiburon Heritage and Arts Commission to highlight artists from underrepresented backgrounds, including artists of color, women and LGBTQ+ artists and artists from different socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>
<p>One of the artists in the show is Novato resident Henry Frank, a 51-year-old who spent 20 years in federal prisons from age 19 to 39.</p>
<p>Frank’s father was of Yurok and Pomo heritage, while his mother was Yurok, Karuk, Tolowa, Dutch and Spanish. His parents split up when he was 5, and he and his younger brother lived with their mother, who battled substance-abuse issues.</p>
<p>“I had to learn to cook and take care of my brother because my mother was always high on heroin,” he says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The agency behind the Yellow Bus Challenge will introduce a pilot late-afternoon route next school year to bring Reed Union district students home from after-school programs and tutoring sessions.</p>
<p>The new route, unanimously approved by the newly renamed Tiburon Peninsula Traffic Alliance board May 2, will leave Bel Aire Elementary School at 4 p.m. and make five stops along Tiburon Boulevard before reaching Reed Elementary School. The bus will then make eight more stops on its return journey before heading out to Paradise Drive via Highway 101, dropping remaining riders in east Corte Madera and Paradise Cay.</p>
<p>It will be the day’s last service for the same bus used earlier in the afternoon to take home St. Hilary Catholic School students, another service that received unanimous approval at the meeting.</p>
<p>Alongside the route expansions, the agency recently announced its rebranding as the Tiburon Peninsula Traffic Alliance to better reflect its broader mission, though the Tiburon Peninsula Traffic Relief Joint Powers Agency, formed in 2016, remains its formal name.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Natty Gove launched the Tech4Youth Foundation in February and is aiming to raise $11,000 to purchase laptops for 30 students in need.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tiburon teen has launched a fundraising effort to ensure all students in the Sausalito-Marin City School District have access to a home computer.</p>
<p>Natty Gove launched the nonprofitTech4Youth Foundationin February and is aiming to raise $11,000 to purchase laptops for 30 students in need.</p>
<p>The Redwood High School sophomore notes about 90% of his homework requires a computer, making him realize how much more difficult it would be to succeed in school if he didn’t have his own at home.</p>
<p>“I just realized basically that in an ever more digitized world, access to this technology is not so much of a luxury as it was pre-COVID, it’s more of a necessity,” says Natty, 15, adding that students who don’t have computers at home can easily fall behind through no fault of their own.</p>]]></content:encoded>
