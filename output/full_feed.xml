      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/the-ark-wins-28-california-journalism-awards-most-decorated-small-publication-of-2024</link>
      <description>The awards included five first-place honors for breaking news, writing, travel writing, photojournalism and feature photo, as well as recognition for public-service journalism.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First place, photojournalism:The Ark won first place based on images captured by contributing photographers Leo Leung, Clara Lu, Ted McDonnell and Nick Shorten Jr. along with Friedland and Martinez.</p>
<p>The Ark is the California News Publishers Association’s most-decorated small publication of 2024, winning 28 California Journalism Awards for its coverage of the Tiburon Peninsula, including five first-place honors for breaking news, writing, photojournalism and feature photo, with a category sweep for travel writing as well as recognition for public-service journalism.</p>
<p>The awards were announced by the 137-year-old nonprofit trade association, which represents more than 700 newspapers across the state, at its annual conference May 17 in Universal City and online over several days following.</p>
<p>The Ark, which has about 2,500 subscribers, generally competes against other printed weeklies with a circulation of 4,300 or fewer that publish three or fewer times a week. As of last year, it also now competes against online publications with 199,000 or fewer unique monthly visitors, where The Ark averages about 5,500.</p>
<p>• Breaking news:Executive Editor Kevin Hessel and former Belvedere reporter Naomi Friedland won first and second. The first-place award was for their coverage ofDecember’s tsunami warning, when local disaster authorities were largely quiet as they relied on AlertMarin to warn residents — even though only a third are signed up and, for those who are, the system suffered significant notification delays.</p>
<p>The second-place award was for their coverage of the community’s efforts tofind a young Tiburon girlwho went missing for three days in May 2024 and was found safe by police in Sacramento.</p>
<p>• Writing:Hessel and Tiburon reporter Francisco Martinez won first place for their article about the owners of the Mallard Point complex in Belvedere revealing a70-unit redevelopment alternativein case their 40-unit plan was required to undergo costly environmental review. The smaller plan was ultimately found exempt and approved.</p>
<p>• Photojournalism:The Ark won first place based on images captured by contributing photographers Leo Leung, Clara Lu, Ted McDonnell and Nick Shorten Jr. along with Friedland and Martinez.</p>
<p>• Feature photo:McDonnell also won first place for his image of Jennifer Torres at the counter of The Candy Store on Main Street in the final days before she closed her shop due to rent increases.</p>

      <title>Belvedere settles profiling suit with Yema shop owners for $10k</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-settles-profiling-suit-with-yema-shop-owners-for-10k</link>
      <description>The city denies wrongdoing in a deal that ends all legal actions related to 2020 incident.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere has agreed to pay $10,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by residents Yema Khalif and Hawi Awash over an incident of alleged racial profiling by police at the couple’s Main Street clothing store in August 2020.</p>
<p>The suit, filed in April 2024 in Marin Superior Court, was dismissed April 17 with prejudice, meaning Khalif and Awash can’t sue the city in the future for related claims. In settling, Belvedere made no admission of liability. Each party is responsible for their own attorney’s fees.</p>
<p>Belvedere paid $5,000 each to Khalif and Awash through its insurer, the California Intergovernmental Risk Authority, City Manager Robert Zadnik said. In a statement, Zadnik said the city “fully supports its Police Department” as well as Chief Jason Wu and Sgt. Jeremy Clark, all of whom were named as defendants in the suit alongside the city.</p>
<p>Clark did not respond to an email seeking comment by The Ark’s press time. Wu referred The Ark to Zadnik’s comment.</p>
<p>Neither Khalif nor Awash responded to voicemails seeking comment on the settlement. Their attorney, David C. Anderson, said in a phone interview Awash and Khalif “decided they had accomplished their primary purpose with litigation anyway with Tiburon.”</p>
<p>“Hopefully Belvedere will make the same kinds of changes Tiburon made on its own,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Navigation app alert system aims to protect firefighters</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/navigation-app-alert-system-aims-to-protect-firefighters</link>
      <description>It sends alerts to drivers’ phones when they’re approaching an emergency vehicle on the roadside or when an emergency vehicle is coming up behind them.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Responding to accidents on the freeway is one of the most dangerous situations firefighters face, according to Tiburon Fire Chief Tommy Hellyer. As emergency responders aid victims of car accidents, freeway traffic continues to pass by — creating a significant hazard.</p>
<p>“We have procedures to block vehicle accidents, but drivers need to slow down and move over,” Hellyer said.</p>
<p>To address this danger, the Tiburon and Southern Marin fire protection districts implemented the HAAS Alert Safety Cloud in April. It sends alerts to drivers’ phones when they’re approaching an emergency vehicle on the roadside or when an emergency vehicle is coming up behind them — potentially before a driver notices the flashing lights or hears the sirens.</p>
<p>“Many drivers these days are distracted or their vehicles have thick windows,” Hellyer said. “We hope this mitigates some of the risk.”</p>
<p>According to the Chicago-based HAAS company, the new system — which Hellyer said costs the Tiburon agency $1,895 per year — could reduce accidents between emergency responders and the public by up to 90%.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Playground experts emphasize accessibility, nature-based play at Tiburon parks forum</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/playground-experts-emphasize-accessibility-nature-based-play-at-tiburon-parks-forum</link>
      <description>The town wants to upgrade the playground at Cypress Hollow Park, potentially put one at Zelinsky Park and make other improvements to the lineal system.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Experts urged Tiburon to prioritize accessibility and nature-based designs in playground renovations during a May 12 forum hosted by the town’s parks board.</p>
<p>About 15 people attended the forum, held at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library and via Zoom. It featured play researchers, an accessibility advocate, playground-equipment representatives and community members who have had success introducing recreation facilities. The event was part of ongoing efforts by the Tiburon Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission to gather community feedback as the town works to implement its parks master plan, a long-term guide for the use of its 56 acres of parks and 316 acres of open space.</p>
<p>“As a community, we have a lot of data, we need to start moving things forward and setting up timelines and deliverables to meet the community’s desires,” commission Chair Chuck Hornbrook said after the meeting. “That said, we will have additional community engagement before people begin to disappear in the summer, where needed, to move improvements forward.”</p>
<p>The Tiburon Town Council at its March 20 meeting indicated it wants to upgrade the playground at Cypress Hollow Park and is examining the feasibility of a play structure at Zelinsky Park, behind the library and Town Hall, while seeking feedback for larger-scale improvements across the Richardson Bay Lineal Park system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>The former contract-furniture executive moved from San Anselmo seeking a one-story home with a two-car garage on the water.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bill Watson has embraced life in Belvedere, where the 80-year-old retiree says he’s been busy enjoying his days since moving to the city in 2021.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what we do every day, but we’re busy,” says Watson, who celebrated his birthday May 15. “I mean, there’s always stuff to do.”</p>
<p>The former contract-furniture executive moved from San Anselmo seeking a one-story home with a two-car garage on the water. Four years later, he says he appreciates the peninsula environment, his neighbors and local amenities.</p>
<p>“We have all the facilities we need,” Watson says.</p>
<p>On May 14, he was strolling down San Rafael Avenue near Community Park after taking his 23-pound rescue dog, Ike — named after President Dwight D. Eisenhower — to the vet for a teeth cleaning. Watson has had the dog for the better part of 13 years and calls him “one of those good friends over the years.”</p>
<p>“You know, they invented love — dogs,” Watson says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reed Union School District teachers are set to receive an 8.15% salary boost over the next two school years — though the president of the teachers’ union says the increase still falls short of what’s needed to keep pace with the high cost of living in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, reached after several months of negotiations between the district and the Reed District Teachers Association, certificated teachers will receive a 5% raise for the 2025-2026 school year, effective July 1.</p>
<p>That will be followed by a 3% increase for the 2026-2027 school year, effective July 1, 2026.</p>
<p>The contract was unanimously approved by the district’s board of trustees on May 13.</p>
<p>“The agreed-upon salary increases reflect the district’s deep commitment to attracting and retaining the best educators, recognizing their immense value, while also ensuring we are responsible stewards of our financial resources to best serve our students and community,” Superintendent Kimberly McGrath said.</p>
<p>However, Reed District Teachers Association President Shea O’Brien, a science teacher at Del Mar Middle School, said that while the union was glad to have reached an agreement, “we believe the contract still falls short of ensuring housing security for all teachers in the Reed Union School District.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Belvedere to ban throttle e-bikes for kids</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-to-ban-throttle-e-bikes-for-kids</link>
      <description>The city will join Tiburon and other Marin municipalities in a countywide pilot program meant to make trails and roads safer for all riders.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere will ban riders under age 16 from using throttle-assisted e-bikes starting in July, joining Tiburon and other Marin municipalities in a countywide pilot program meant to make trails and roads safer for all riders.</p>
<p>The City Council voted unanimously May 12 to establish an ordinance with the age restriction and a rule requiring all legal riders of throttle-assisted bikes to wear helmets. Councilmembers will conduct their second, required vote for adoption at their June 9 meeting.</p>
<p>“I’m really pleased that Belvedere’s joining the rest of the county in this effort,” Mayor Jane Cooper said. “It’s, I think, keeping children safe and keeping community members safe. We’ve heard a lot about it from the community and the concern with the e-bike riders being a little bit wild.”</p>
<p>The county-specific pilot program runs through 2029 under Assembly Bill 1778, authored by Assemblymember Damon Connolly, D-San Rafael, and signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom last year.</p>
<p>The Marin Board of Supervisors in March voted to implement the same age-restriction and helmet rules on throttle-assisted Class 2 e-bikes — which can reach speeds of 20 mph without pedaling, though easily accessible hacks allow them to travel significantly faster — in unincorporated areas, including Strawberry and Paradise Cay.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>City joins campaign against boulevard bike lanes</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/city-joins-campaign-against-boulevard-bike-lanes</link>
      <description>Belvedere is again raising safety concerns, this time taking its appeal directly to the state.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belvedere City Council is again raising safety concerns about Caltrans’ plans to add bike lanes along Tiburon Boulevard as part of a wider repaving project next year — this time taking its appeal directly to the state.</p>
<p>But Caltrans’ officials have made it clear: “The bike lanes will stay.”</p>
<p>In Belvedere’s latest letter, to Caltrans Bay Area district chief Dina El-Tawansy, Mayor Jane Cooper and City Manager Robert Zadnik cited “safety hazards” from “unprotected bike lanes,” particularly near Reed Ranch Road, Blackie’s Pasture and the Highway 101 interchange. The letter also cited impacts to Marin Transit bus stops, likely loss of school-bus stops between Blackfield Drive and Trestle Glen Boulevard, emergency-response risks and “increased congestion and commuter disruption.”</p>
<p>“The pace and lack of transparency have blindsided key stakeholders and left critical concerns unresolved,” it says. “We also question whether early letters of support from county and state officials were based on a complete understanding of the project’s real-world impacts — and whether that support still stands in light of current agency and community objections.”</p>
<p>The $23 million project’s design is 95% complete as of Feb. 28, with finalization expected by mid-summer, when it will go out to bid. Construction is planned to begin in winter 2026 and last one year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The blue segments represent Class-2 bike lanes, or marked on-road lanes alongside traffic that don’t have a physical barrier; the red segments are Class-4 separated bikeways, which are also on the roadway but protected from traffic; and the gold segment is a Class-1 bike path, which is away from the road, like the Old Rail Trail.

      <title>Belvedere’s $14.2M draft budget prioritizes Beach Road seawall</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-s-14-2m-draft-budget-prioritizes-beach-road-seawall</link>
      <description>The city is expected to spend $2.66 million to stabilize the seawall while also allocating more toward legal expenses amid ongoing lawsuits.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere is expected to spend $2.66 million in the upcoming fiscal year to stabilize the Beach Road seawall and levee while also allocating more toward legal expenses amid ongoing lawsuits challenging the city’s construction-time-limit fines.</p>
<p>Driven by the Beach Road project, the draft budget for fiscal year 2025-2026, which begins July 1, anticipates $14.22 million in expenditures against $11.38 million in revenue, leaving a deficit of $2.84 million that will be covered by withdrawals from the city’s general and critical-infrastructure funds.</p>
<p>Despite the deficit, Administrative Services Director Helga Cotter said the city will still meet its general-fund reserve goal of at least 50% of expected expenditures plus the cost of fire and pension-debt services for fiscal 2026 and the four subsequent fiscal years. Belvedere is expected to finish fiscal 2026 in June with a 51% reserve, or $4.62 million where $4.58 million is required.</p>
<p>The draft budget was presented at the City Council’s May 12 meeting, with a council vote to formally adopt the budget expected June 9.</p>
<p>Operating expenditures of $10.1 million are up 11.3% from the current year, with nearly three-quarters related to personnel and the city’s $2.49-million fire-protection contract with the Tiburon Fire Protection District. Operating revenues of $10.81 million will create a $712,193 surplus for fiscal 2026 when excluding capital projects.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Medical drama hits home for ER chief shaped by Columbine and Aurora tragedies</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/medical-drama-hits-home-for-er-chief-shaped-by-columbine-and-aurora-tragedies</link>
      <description>Tiburon's Christopher Colwell is chief of emergency medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Christopher Colwell, watching an episode of “The Pitt” isn’t just entertainment — it’s a reflection of his reality. The medical drama streaming on Max takes place inside an overcrowded, underfunded emergency room, and it features real cases, he says, even if there’s some added theatrics.</p>
<p>“What ‘The Pitt’ does is the closest thing to what I do that I’ve ever seen,” says the 59-year-old Tiburon resident, who serves as chief of emergency medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center.</p>
<p>Colwell speaks from extensive experience. Before moving to the Bay Area in 2016, he served as emergency-medicine director at Denver Health hospital from 2010 to 2016, where he earlier worked as medical director for both the Denver Fire Department and Denver Health’s paramedic division.</p>
<p>It was during his Denver tenure that Colwell responded to the 1999 Columbine High School massacre that left 14 dead and the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, movie-theater shooting that killed 13. He was in San Francisco for the 2017 UPS-facility shooting where three died.</p>
<p>His expertise from these tragedies informs his work overseeing an emergency department that treats 76,000 patients a year and has shaped him into an authoritative voice on disaster management, mass-casualty events, COVID-19 responses and wildfire health impacts. He’s sought out to speak at medical conferences, as an expert voice in the press and even to review TV shows for medical accuracy, as he did for “The Pitt” in online magazine Slate in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <media:description>Tiburon resident Christopher Colwell is the chief of the emergency-medicine department at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, a position he’s held since 2016. Prior to that, he spent nearly 20 years at Denver Health, including six years as emergency-medicine chief from 2010 to 2016. At Denver Health, he was on the scene during the 1999 Columbine High School shooting and led the response to the 2012 Aurora movie theater killings. He’s become a leader in discussing how to handle mass-casualty events from a medical standpoint, talking at conferences and to news outlets. (Francisco Martinez / The Ark)</media:description>

      <title>Tiburon resident trades tech career for Detroit-style pizza</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-resident-trades-tech-career-for-detroit-style-pizza</link>
      <description>Tiburon resident Joe Garfola is now serving up Motor City-style pies as the owner of Squared Pizza at the Bon Aire Center.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As much as Tiburon resident Joe Garfola enjoys pizza, he says he’d get a little homesick whenever he and his family would order a circular pie.</p>
<p>Garfola is from Detroit, where square pizza reigns supreme. He says he noticed there was a dearth of options in Marin County that served it up — so he decided to fill the gap.</p>
<p>“We wanted to have the opportunity to provide it for others, of course, but also have the pizza that we’d like to eat,” he says.</p>
<p>Garfola is now serving up Motor City-style pies as the owner of Squared Pizza at the Bon Aire Center in Greenbrae. After a soft launch in late March, the restaurant had its grand opening May 3.</p>
<p>The shop offers all the classic pizza toppings, from pepperoni and sausage to onions, olives, jalapeños and mushrooms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Officials emphasize emergency preparation during resident chat</title>

      <description>“Our goal is to take little baby steps in emergency preparedness to get everybody involved and understand what takes place in being prepared."</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere officials are reminding residents to prioritize emergency preparedness, including having three days’ worth of supplies ready in case of a disaster and making sure they sign up for alerts to receive timely information from authorities.</p>
<p>City Manager Robert Zadnik and Councilmember Pat Carapiet discussed Belvedere’s emergency-prep efforts at an informal April 30 community chat attended by more than 20 residents at Larry Binkley and Kathy Huber’s West Shore Road home.</p>
<p>Carapiet said emergency preparedness has been at the forefront of everyone’s mind following the Los Angeles wildfires in January, which burned more than 50,000 acres and destroyed more than 16,000 homes and commercial properties across Pacific Palisades, Malibu and Altadena.</p>
<p>The April 30 chat followed a Feb. 25 Tiburon Peninsula-wide community forum on fire safety hosted by Tiburon Mayor Holli Thier and Belvedere Mayor Jane Cooper.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to take little baby steps in emergency preparedness to get everybody involved and understand what takes place in being prepared,” Carapiet said, adding that conversations with Belvedere Police Chief Jason Wu, the Tiburon Fire Protection District and Marin emergency-preparedness organizations have prompted one top goal for residents: “You yourself have to be prepared.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>In addition to teaching music classes, Carolyn Balfe also leads a lunchtime chorus for second graders and another second-grade club called Community Time Leaders.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reed Elementary School music teacher Carolyn Balfe has been named the Rotary Club of Tiburon-Belvedere’s educator of the year, recognizing her standout efforts to engage students and the enthusiasm she brings to the school community.</p>
<p>Balfe was honored by Rotary May 7 at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library, where she received $600 from the club.</p>
<p>The Educator of the Year honors are typically given out annually to at least one teacher each within the Reed Union School District and at St. Hilary School who are chosen by their peers. Rotary Club Public Image Chair Judy Wilson said St. Hilary School had not selected its honoree by the May 7 ceremony and that the club would work with the school to honor its chosen educator later.</p>
<p>Balfe called the recognition “a happy surprise,” adding that “my job sparks joy in others and it brings me joy, so it’s a win-win.”</p>
<p>She’s in her 10th year teaching at Reed school and her 26th overall. In addition to teaching music classes, she also leads a lunchtime chorus for second graders and another second-grade club called Community Time Leaders, who help lead the school’s weekly assemblies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Rare waterfront Eichler on West Shore Road hits market for $11.58 million</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/rare-waterfront-eichler-on-west-shore-road-hits-market-for-11-58-million</link>
      <description>Interior designer Pam Robertson and her husband, Jim, have owned the home for 26 years and still have the original design plans.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A waterfront mid-century modern Belvedere home designed by architect A. Quincy Jones and built by pioneering developer Joseph Eichler is on the market for $11.58 million.</p>
<p>The 2,190-square-foot four-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom home at 27 West Shore Road features an open floor plan covering the living room, dining area, sitting area and kitchen. There’s also a 430-square-foot two-car garage and an outdoor space with a lawn, deck, fire pit, spa and boat dock situated on Richardson Bay, with views of Sausalito and the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
<p>Shana Rohde-Lynch, the Tiburon Peninsula real-estate agent listing the property, said the home represents California, calling it unique because it feels like a Malibu beach house seated on Richardson Bay.</p>
<p>“To actually go through that living space on the bay and see the Golden Gate Bridge and all of Sausalito is very unique — and with your own private boat dock,” Rohde-Lynch said. “It doesn’t get much better than that for California living.”</p>
<p>While Eichler homes are in Marin, they’re mainly in northern San Rafael, Rohde-Lynch said, “so it’s rare to see them on the water.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Korean noodle dish from her medical school days has Yamilee Bermingham eager to recreate those flavors in her Tiburon kitchen.</p>
<p>She recalls her first taste of japchae, a sweet-potato noodle dish with vegetables and sauce that she encountered while studying at Yale University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>What she enjoyed about the dish, Bermingham says during a May 7 visit to the Belvedere-Tiburon Library, was the blend of sweetness with the vegetables, as well as it being a new flavor, and “the care with which the person who had the food truck … made it available to us.”</p>

      <title>Literature is inspiration behind newest library art exhibit</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/literature-is-inspiration-behind-newest-library-art-exhibit</link>
      <description>More than three dozen artists will display 50 works inspired by authors, novels and literary passages in “Art Inspired by Literature."</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than three dozen artists will display 50 works inspired by authors, novels and literary passages in “Art Inspired by Literature” at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library.</p>
<p>The exhibit runs May 15-July 10, with an artists’ reception from 6 to 8 p.m. on opening night. The reception includes a youth-focused event, “Turning Stories into Art,” with a supervised story time and crafts in the Children’s Room from 6 to 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Tiburon’s Julia Baker is exhibiting “A Letter to an American Woman Who Wants to Learn French,” a painting inspired by a magazine passage that echoed her French great-grandmother’s journey to America in the late 1800s.</p>
<p>When Baker’s mother was reorganizing the family home, she found a box filled with old letters, photos and all kinds of documents left by her ancestor. Baker is now using the old ephemera in her mixed-media work. These include a vintage envelope addressed to her grandmother, a faded photograph of her great-grandmother sitting on the lawn and the front of a letter the woman wrote in French, now barely visible.</p>
<p>“For me, this painting is a meditation on memory, migration and the way language both connects and obscures,” Baker says. “It’s a visual letter back through time, an imagined response to a real woman who already knew the language of the heart. I used the magazine page as an image transfer, so the title and article read backward — a visual echo of how stories shift overtime, especially across languages and generations.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Garden Plot: Think carefully about how to conserve water</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/garden-plot-think-carefully-about-how-to-conserve-water</link>
      <description>No rain means no option except to turn on the spigot, unless you were smart — or hardworking — enough to have set up a system of capturing water from your downspouts.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re entering our annual drought season. You can count on no rain of any consequence from May until October or November at the earliest. This leaves us with no option except to turn on the spigot, unless you were smart — or hardworking — enough to have set up a system of capturing water from your downspouts. This would be something to plan now for next winter’s rains. Most of Marin’s water comes from the Mount Tamalpais watershed, which feeds five of the seven reservoirs in the county. About 75% of the county’s water supply is stored in these reservoirs, and the remainder comes from the Russian River.</p>]]></content:encoded>
