     <title>Belvedere OKs housing plan, zoning overhaul for state approval</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-oks-housing-plan-zoning-overhaul-for-state-approval</link>
     <description>The votes effectively end nearly four years of work to bring the city into compliance with state housing requirements.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belvedere City Council unanimously approved a package of housing reforms Nov. 10, effectively ending nearly four years of work to bring the city into compliance with state requirements to accommodate at least 160 new housing units.</p>
<p>Officials voted to formally adopt the state-mandated 2023-2031 housing element and, in a separate vote, approved a set of zoning amendments that will allow for new development under the eight-year roadmap.</p>
<p>The California Department of Housing and Community Development indicated in July that revisions in the fourth draft of the element — which was required to be in place by Jan. 31, 2023 — would comply with state law but, because the city missed several implementation deadlines, the element could not be certified until the zoning amendments are in place.</p>
<p>The City Council is expected to formally adopt those amendments in a required second vote Dec. 8, after which Belvedere will submit both documents to Sacramento for review and certification.</p>
<p>The changes address affordable-housing requirements and incentives, streamlined approvals for developments with at least 20% affordable units, updated design and development standards, mixed-use housing, emergency shelters, parking and reasonable-accommodation requests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere shifting coyote reporting to Marin Humane</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-shifting-coyote-reporting-to-marin-humane</link>
     <description>Since 2023, at least five dogs and four cats have been killed by coyotes, and seven other pets have been injured, according to reports received by the city.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere residents will soon report coyote sightings to Marin Humane rather than the city under a new agreement that will maintain most of the response services residents have received for the past two years.</p>
<p>The city already pays the nonprofit $25,000 annually, its share of an agreement with Marin County to provide animal-control services to cities and towns countywide. It will now pay an additional $7,800 per year for a separate coyote-focused contract that will handle all coyote-related incidents, including receiving reports about local coyote sightings and interactions. The arrangement represents a slight savings over the $8,000 the city has been paying consultant Rebecca Dmytryk annually since 2023.</p>
<p>The agreement, set to be finalized by the end of the month, signals a shift in strategy for Belvedere, which contracted with Dmytryk of Humane Wildlife Control to create a comprehensive coyote-management plan and evaluate coyote-denning behavior. During that time, the city received and tracked reports directly through a dedicated hotline and web submission form, and officials worked with Dmytryk to respond to incidents when necessary.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>The Tiburon Peninsula Chamber of Commerce’s annual holiday festival anchors the events, scheduled for 2-5 p.m. Dec. 6.</description>

     <title>Belvedere homeowners face $2,928 fee to exit historic designation</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-homeowners-face-2-928-fee-to-exit-historic-designation</link>
     <description>Belvedere residents who missed out on the Mills Act tax-incentive program can get $366 streamlined removal.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere homeowners who want out of the city’s historic designation program must pay $2,928 and navigate a multistep approval process under fees the City Council unanimously approved Nov. 10.</p>
<p>The council offered a break to five homeowners caught in limbo when the city ended its Mills Act program. Those who won historic designation between June 1, 2021, and May 1, 2024, but never received the program’s property-tax breaks, can apply for streamlined removal by Feb. 13 and pay just $366.</p>
<p>Both fees took effect immediately.</p>
<p>The vote put the finishing touches on an ordinance the council adopted in October that creates the first formal pathway for property owners to exit the program. Some 30 homes in Belvedere hold historic designation.</p>
<p>To be removed, homeowners must pay the fee, submit an application explaining why decertification is warranted, win approval from the Historic Preservation Committee and earn final sign-off from the City Council.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Reality TV pilot spotlights Cinelounge Tiburon owners’ fight to save movie theaters</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reality-tv-pilot-spotlights-cinelounge-tiburon-owners-fight-to-save-movie-theaters</link>
     <description>Mill Valley’s Alexandra Duparc filmed Christian and Camilla Meoli for the “Saving Cinema” pilot in October.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A director who co-wrote a $34 million Netflix legal drama has turned her camera on downtown Tiburon’s Cinelounge, filming a reality TV pilot about the theater’s husband-and-wife owners and their mission to save the moviegoing experience.</p>
<p>Mill Valley’s Alexandra Duparc filmed Christian and Camilla Meoli for the “Saving Cinema” pilot Oct. 26-27. She is still shopping the show, which blends reality footage with scripted elements, to streaming services.</p>
<p>Duparc previously co-wrote “Monsanto,” a yet-to-be filmed legal drama with “The Blind Side” director John Lee Hancock, who is directing “Monsanto.” The film is set to star Glen Powell, Anthony Mackie and Laura Dern.</p>
<p>Friends and associates encouraged Duparc to meet the Meolis. The instant connection led her to assist with Cinelounge’s fundraising efforts as the theater works to transition to a nonprofit. She also began managing its social media.</p>
<p>“Then in doing that, I think I just felt deeply more in love with all of it and went like, ‘You know, I think that the world needs to know that these kinds of things are happening because for something that’s such a dying business, there’s not very many people holding the net to save anyone,’” Duparc says. “And it’s kind of freaking me out.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>Cinelounge owners and Tiburon residents Christian and Camilla Meoli film the reality TV pilot ‘Saving Cinema’ at their 40 Main St. theater Oct. 27.

     <title>Tiburon council will review traffic study in January following delays</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-council-will-review-traffic-study-in-january-following-delays</link>
     <description>The consultant attributed the delays to Caltrans taking additional time to finalize its 4.6-mile preventive-maintenance project of Tiburon Boulevard.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Initial findings from Tiburon’s traffic study are now expected to be presented to the Town Council in January, some seven months later than the original target date. The consultant in charge of the project has attributed the delays to Caltrans taking additional time to finalize its 4.6-mile preventive-maintenance project of Tiburon Boulevard set to begin next summer.</p>
<p>Representatives from Parametrix, the firm hired by the town to complete the traffic study, previously said they hoped to have results to present to the town in June. However, the firm had to slow down its work as Caltrans, which is responsible for maintaining Tiburon Boulevard as State Route 131, weighed the details of its preventative-maintenance projects, including whether to include controversial bike lanes along Tiburon Boulevard from Trestle Glen Boulevard to Blackfield Drive and if it could incorporate Tiburon’s plans to install conduit that could carry fiber-optic cables, Public Works engineering manager David Eshoo said Nov. 14.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere-Tiburon Library exhibit pairs Bay Area creators with muses from art history</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-tiburon-library-exhibit-pairs-bay-area-creators-with-muses-from-art-history</link>
     <description>Rachel Davis, Nadine Levin and Joyce Bell are among 58 Bay Area artists featured in “Pairings &amp; Echoes,” which runs Nov. 20 through Jan. 7.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Rachel Davis stared at the figure in her painting “Surrender, After Suzanne and Esther,” she knew something was wrong. She tried 10 different faces over as many months. Her fellow artists at ICB Art in Sausalito rallied around her, posing and offering advice. The running joke became: “Whose head is on the body today?”</p>
<p>The answer, finally, was none at all.</p>
<p>Davis, Nadine Levin and Joyce Bell are among 58 Bay Area artists featured in “Pairings & Echoes,” an exhibit at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library that explores artistic conversations across time and medium. The show runs Nov. 20 through Jan. 7, with an artists’ reception from 6 to 8 p.m. Nov. 20.</p>
<p>Each artist submitted work inspired by another artist’s creation. Posted alongside each piece will be a small image of the work that sparked the new art.</p>
<p>Exhibit co-chair Katie Sutton said she’s particularly excited for this show, noting that it’s “something a little different” to see how artists take inspiration from an existing work and make it their own.</p>
<p>“Some lean into a more literal visual approach, while others focus more on the emotional side of their reference,” Sutton said. “It’s so interesting to watch their creativity come to life and see into the mind of each artist.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Builder reveals design of $12 mil hybrid vessel for Angel Island-Tiburon Ferry Co.</title>

     <description>EV Maritime is designing the 64-foot plug-in-hybrid vessel tentatively named Watts Up.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New Zealand firm building the Angel Island-Tiburon Ferry Co.’s new plug-in-hybrid vessel has unveiled the design, marking a major milestone in the first-in-California effort to electrify the fleet.</p>
<p>EV Maritime is designing the 64-foot plug-in-hybrid vessel tentatively named Watts Up. The company revealed the design exclusively to The Ark following a Nov. 10 interview with CEO and co-founder Michael Eaglen and ferry company owner Capt. Maggie McDonogh.</p>
<p>Eaglen said having a rendering ready shows the project is advancing. The team is “more firmly committing when you’re telling other people what it’s going to look like.”</p>
<p>The ferry company and EV Maritime partnered in July 2024 to build the roughly $12 million vessel as part of a $24 million grant from the California Air Resources Board awarded through the town of Tiburon. Matching grants bring total funding to $31 million.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Eugene (‘Gene’) Allan McCabe</title>

     <description>Eugene (‘Gene’) Allan McCabe: May 18, 1933–November 3, 2025</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May 18, 1933– November 3, 2025</p>
<p>His educational, military, social, outdoor, and professional accomplishments reflected the intelligence and hard work of an honorable self-made man who rose from humble beginnings. Yet Gene’s purposeful life was defined by far more than his degrees, titles, or accolades.</p>
<p>Guided by unwavering integrity — and strengthened by the discipline and courage to always do what was right — he found deep and lasting happiness. His life was enriched by genuine friendships, by days filled with affection, service, and by a respect for those around him.</p>
<p>Gene met his first wife, Debby McCabe, beneath Sather Gate, where their story began. They shared 53 years of marriage until her passing in 2010. Soon after, Joy Kuhn McCabe entered his life. Warmly welcomed by her family, at age 78 Gene began a new chapter, settling into a new Marin life with Joy. Together, he and Joy traveled, entertained friends and family, and found great pleasure in simply being together.</p>
<p>Gene also treasured the company of friends from all walks of life — from his college fraternity and ski patrol days to those he met through the many clubs and organizations he joined or supported across the East Bay, San Francisco, and Marin County. Among these friends were those in and around the Bohemian Club’s electricity-free Iron Ring camp, where he found camaraderie — and first met Joy during a picnic.</p>
<p>He is survived by his devoted wife, Joy Kuhn McCabe of Tiburon; his brother, Jack; his daughter, Martha; his son, Charlie; stepchildren Steve (Teri) Kuhn, Gary (Heidi) Kühn, and Leslie (Frank) Doyle; grandchildren and step-great-grandchildren; and many cousins, nieces, and nephews.</p>
<p>He passed away at age 92, as he had lived — happily, surrounded by family, on his own terms, with independence, dignity, and grace.</p>
<p>A private family memorial service will be held. His love, kindness, honesty, and understanding remain an enduring inspiration to all who knew him. And when a man of integrity and accomplishment is fortunate enough to experience two great loves in a single lifetime — first with Debby, and then with Joy — what greater gifts could life offer?</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Lorrie Lee Levin Greene, a lifelong Bay Area native, passed away surrounded by family peacefully at home on November 7, 2025, at the age of 83.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>March 4, 1942– November 7, 2025</p>
<p>Lorrie Lee Levin Greene, a lifelong Bay Area native, passed away surrounded by family peacefully at home on November 7, 2025, at the age of 83.</p>
<p>Born and raised in San Francisco, Lorrie attended Lowell High School before graduating from the University of California, Berkeley in 1962 where she was a proud member of Alpha Epsilon Phi. It was there, in the spring of 1960, that she met her husband of 62 years, Richard Lawrence Greene — he was a senior while she was a freshman. Their story began when he playfully pushed her in a fraternity pushcart race, sparking a romance that led to their marriage on January 27, 1963, and more than six decades of love, laughter, travel and partnership.</p>
<p>After settling in Tiburon, California, Lorrie and Richard built a warm and welcoming home filled with family, friendship, and art. For decades, Lorrie hosted many fabulous parties at their Tiburon home bringing together lifelong friends and the community. Together, they shared an extraordinary sense of adventure, traveling to more than 70 countries around the world and embracing every new culture and experience with curiosity and joy.</p>
<p>Lorrie was a devoted wife to Richard Lawrence Greene, loving mother to Dana Michele Greene (Bryan Rickert), Julie Allyson Greene McEver (AJ McEver), and Elisa Suzanne Greene Briles (Tyler Briles), beloved sister to Michael Levin and a proud grandmother to Ella Rylee McEver and Kaylen Tyler McEver, who brought her endless joy.</p>
<p>Lorrie held a multitude of positions throughout her life — working as a teacher, interior designer, and office move consultant. She also lent her artistic eye to Richard’s professional spaces, designing all three of his offices — from the furniture to the art work, ensuring that the firm had a first-class look.</p>
<p>A passionate advocate for art, education, and community, Lorrie founded NCC-NMWA (the Northern California Committee of the National Museum of Women in the Arts) and StreetSmart4Kids – Dine Out and Donate, an organization that brought restaurants and local communities together to support Bay Area children in need. She served on the Reed School District PTA, was a Marin Day School (now Bright Horizons Daycare) board member, and led the KQED auction for several years.</p>
<p>Lorrie was a patron of the arts, a champion of women, and a trusted friend to everyone she met. Her incredible vibrancy, sense of style, warmth and generosity to everyone leav...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>William Blackmer Canada</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/william-blackmer-canada</link>
     <description>William Blackmer Canada, born on November 8, 1939, at St. John’s Hospital in Tulsa, OK, passed away on November 3rd.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>William Blackmer Canada, born on November 8, 1939, at St. John’s Hospital in Tulsa, OK, passed away on November 3rd after a courageous battle with prostate cancer. Bill was the beloved son of Edith and Alonzo F. Canada. His early years were spent in Tulsa, attending Barnard Elementary and Wilson Middle schools before his family relocated to Downey, California. There, he graduated from Downey High School in 1957. Bill returned to Oklahoma to study at Oklahoma State University, where he earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Industrial Engineering.</p>
<p>In 1962, Bill was commissioned as an officer in the Army, beginning active duty at Ft. Bragg, NC. He completed a basic officer’s course and attended flight school at Ft. Rucker, AL, graduating in 1963. Shortly after, he embarked on a distinguished career with American Airlines, where he served as a dedicated pilot and retired as captain in September 1999.</p>
<p>An enthusiastic sailor and avid skier, Bill’s love for adventure led him to the Corinthian Yacht Club, where he met his wife, Chris, in 1977. The couple married in 1978 aboard their Islander 36, sailing down Raccoon Straits under full spinnaker. Bill’s passion for sailing was evident in his commitment to the Corinthian Yacht Club, which he joined in December 1974. He served as Commodore in 1991 and 1992, leaving a lasting impact on the community.</p>
<p>In 2000, Bill joined the St. Francis Yacht Club, quickly becoming an active and valued member. He was dedicated to volunteering for the race committee, bringing his expertise and enthusiasm to the Big Boat Series and many other regattas. Bill was renowned for his meticulous attention to detail and his talent for fostering camaraderie among sailors and volunteers.</p>
<p>After many years of competitive sailboat racing, Bill embraced a new chapter by purchasing a motor yacht he named “Jazz,” reflecting his lifelong love of music and the arts. Summers spent aboard Jazz at Tinsley Island became a cherished tradition for Bill and his family, filled with warm Delta breezes, gatherings with friends, and unforgettable nights under the stars.</p>

     <title>Tiburon hires consultant to prepare for rising sea levels</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-hires-consultant-to-prepare-for-rising-sea-levels</link>
     <description>Tiburon will spend nearly $600,000 in state grant money to hire a consultant to plan how the town will address rising sea levels threatening its shorelines.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will spend nearly $600,000 in state grant money to hire a consultant to plan how the town will address rising sea levels threatening its shorelines.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted 3-0 Nov. 5 to approve a contract with multinational firm Moffatt and Nichol for the work, which will cost $593,877 using funds awarded in June by the California Ocean Protection Council.</p>
<p>All coastal jurisdictions are required to create a sea-level-rise vulnerability assessment and adaptation plan, known formally as a Subregional Shoreline Adaptation Plan, by 2034 under Senate Bill 272.</p>
<p>Grace Ledwith, Tiburon’s climate action and sustainability coordinator, said while the county has done various vulnerability assessments and sea-level rise studies, none covered town-specific vulnerabilities and assets.</p>
<p>“This will be a first-time effort really diving into our specific concerns,” Ledwith told councilmembers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon officer charged with DUI, child cruelty, pleads not guilty</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-officer-charged-with-dui-child-cruelty-pleads-not-guilty</link>
     <description>Tiburon police officer William Forrest Condit has pleaded not guilty to one count of misdemeanor child cruelty and two counts of misdemeanor drunken driving.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon police officer William Forrest Condit has pleaded not guilty to one count of misdemeanor child cruelty and two counts of misdemeanor drunken driving following his Oct. 13 arrest near downtown Petaluma. Both DUI counts carry sentencing-enhancement requests for endangerment of a child passenger.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old Sebastopol resident entered the plea in Sonoma County Superior Court Nov. 10. The county District Attorney’s Office formally filed the charges Nov. 5.</p>
<p>Condit has been with the Tiburon Police Department since 2019 and was placed on administrative leave following his arrest, Chief Michelle Jean said last month. He was off duty when Petaluma police conducted a traffic stop after observing indications of impaired driving, authorities said.</p>
<p>Petaluma police and the District Attorney’s Office both declined to comment on further details, including Condit’s relationship to the child, his blood-alcohol level or how it was measured.</p>
<p>The DUI charges are for driving under the influence of alcohol and for driving with a blood-alcohol content exceeding 0.08%, California’s legal maximum for those 21 and older.</p>
<p>If convicted, Condit could face up to six months in jail, more than $10,000 in fines after penalty assessments, suspension of his driver’s license and probation. The child-endangerment enhancements each carry an additional mandatory 48 hours in jail.</p>
<p>Under state law, a defendant can be charged with but not convicted of both the endangerment enhancements and the child-cruelty charge for the same incident.</p>
<p>If convicted of the cruelty charge instead, Condit could face an additional one year in jail, another $5,000 in fines after penalties, mandatory probation of at least four years and a mandatory criminal protective order.</p>
<p>Jean said Oct. 20 that the town is reviewing the case with an independent investigator to determine whether any department policies were violated.</p>
<p>“Pending the results of both the criminal investigation and administrative review, (we) will take appropriate action that reflects the values of the department,” she said.</p>
<p>Jean did not respond to requests for comment after the charges were filed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: An aspiring actor encourages others to follow their dreams</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-an-aspiring-actor-encourages-others-to-follow-their-dreams</link>
     <description>The 31-year-old Tiburon resident from Tijuana, Mexico, is recently secured her first paid gig in Los Angeles.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karen Gomez says she’s wanted to be an actor since she was a kid.</p>
<p>Now, the 31-year-old Tiburon resident from Tijuana, Mexico, is making progress toward that goal. She recently secured her first paid gig in Los Angeles — something both exciting and macabre: Gomez played a zombie for an ad that will appear on TikTok.</p>
<p>“It makes me feel like this dream was always possible, and that you, me and all of us have the ability to do it,” Gomez says in an interview conducted in Spanish as she sat on the banks near the Railroad Marsh Nov. 4. “It’s a matter of focus or, rather, truly following your dreams. I believe when you’ve got clarity on what you want, you’ll accomplish it.”</p>
<p>Gomez says she’s always loved to write and sing. Her mother shares those creative impulses, she says, taking pictures, reading and writing. Gomez remembers watching her mom do dubbing work as part of her university studies, an experience that wowed the young girl.</p>
<p>“I feel I got that from her,” Gomez says of her mom’s artistic interests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Mahjong’s moment: Local classes draw all ages as tactile, social game sees surge in popularity</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/mahjong-s-moment</link>
     <description>Throughout the Tiburon Peninsula — offered by the Belvedere-Tiburon Library, Strawberry Recreation District and The Ranch — mahjong classes are exploding in popularity.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twelve-year-old Strawberry resident Julien Letard leans over 144 mahjong tiles spread on the table at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library Nov. 4. A lollipop hangs from his mouth as he moves the tiles — decorated with dragons, flowers and Chinese characters — from the mahjong wall to his rack. The room is quiet except for the click and clack of tiles and Letard’s voice as he teaches novice adults how to play.</p>
<p>The scene is far from the centuries-old Chinese game’s origins with Asian elders, but it reflects a growing national trend. Mahjong is having a moment, increasingly found in bars, restaurants and public spaces as people seek real-world social interaction after the pandemic. Mahjong events in the U.S. jumped 179% between 2023 and 2024, according to Eventbrite.</p>
<p>Throughout the Tiburon Peninsula — offered by the Belvedere-Tiburon Library, Strawberry Recreation District and The Ranch — mahjong classes are exploding in popularity. Residents of all ages are catching on, finding community and competition amid clacking tiles.</p>
<p>The Ranch, Tiburon and Belvedere’s joint recreation agency, has held seven beginner mahjong course series since late 2024. Strawberry Rec began its own beginner classes in October. The library launched Tuesday-night open play sessions in August. Both The Ranch and Strawberry Rec plan to start new open-play sessions in early 2026.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Strawberry senior-housing project enters 60-day fast-track review</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-senior-housing-project-enters-60-day-fast-track-review</link>
     <description>Marin County planners deemed complete the application for a 106-unit senior-living facility on Strawberry’s North Knoll Road on Nov. 6.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marin County planners deemed complete the application for a 106-unit senior-living facility on Strawberry’s North Knoll Road on Nov. 6, starting a 60-day timeline that could see the project approved by Jan. 4 despite fierce opposition from neighbors.</p>
<p>The finding by the county’s Community Development Agency triggered the ministerial-review period for the Spirit Living Group project, a streamlining process that requires the 150,655-square-foot facility to meet objective standards but does not allow for public hearings or subjective judgment.</p>
<p>The county must first complete a 30-day consistency analysis, due by Dec. 6, to determine whether the proposal conforms to local code requirements such as the number of stories, height and setback standards, Senior Planner Megan Alton said last week. The project is eligible for waivers to ensure it can be built to capacity, and the developer is seeking to exceed the allowed number of stories and maximum lot coverage.</p>
<p>Alton said the consistency analysis will be made public. If the code requirements are met, the county must approve the project by Jan. 4, allowing Spirit Living to apply for building permits. If there are any inconsistencies not covered by the waiver request, the developers can modify that request by the approval deadline or face denial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon sirens may sound Nov. 13 after residents couldn’t hear drill alert</title>

     <description>Tiburon’s emergency sirens may sound intermittently between 10 a.m. and noon Nov. 13 as crews perform maintenance.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon’s emergency sirens may sound intermittently between 10 a.m. and noon Nov. 13 as crews perform maintenance in response to residents reporting they couldn’t hear the sirens during last month’s statewide Great ShakeOut earthquake drill.</p>
<p>“We’re just trying to check and make sure everything is working properly,” Emergency Services Coordinator Laurie Nilsen of the Tiburon Police Department said.</p>
<p>She said the maintenance will be conducted on four of the town’s five sirens — those at the downtown Tiburon Boulevard fire station, Del Mar Middle School, the Tiburon Corporation Yard behind Reed Elementary and the Paradise Cove treatment plant near Paradise Beach Park.</p>
<p>A fifth siren at the Paradise Drive fire station is temporarily offline during construction of the new facility, Nilsen said.</p>
<p>The maintenance work is separate from the town’s regular 15-second emergency siren tests at noon Saturdays.</p>
<p>Nilsen encouraged residents to stay informed about emergencies by signing up for alerts atalertmarin.org. Residents who hear sirens during non-test periods should seek emergency information atemergency.marincounty.gov, municipal websites or by tuning to 840 AM radio.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon bans all sales of tobacco in first U.S. law with no exemptions</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-bans-all-sales-of-tobacco-in-first-u-s-law-with-no-exemptions</link>
     <description>Tiburon joins Manhattan Beach and Beverly Hills in banning tobacco sales, but the laws in the two Southern California cities allow for exceptions.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon has become the first city in the nation to ban all tobacco sales without exemptions.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted 4-0, with Vice Mayor Jon Welner absent, at its Nov. 5 meeting to formally adopt the ordinanceafter approving it Oct. 15. The ban is set to take effect Dec. 5.</p>
<p>The new law has little practical effect, as no businesses within town limits sell tobacco: CVS stopped selling tobacco nationwide in 2014, and the Tiburon Boulevard gas stations are in unincorporated Marin.</p>
<p>Tiburon joins Manhattan Beach and Beverly Hills in banning tobacco sales, but the laws in the two Southern California cities allow for exceptions. Beverly Hills allows hotels to sell to guests, and Manhattan Beach includes a hardship exemption for businesses.</p>
<p>Tiburon’s law does not apply to Food and Drug Administration-authorized products intended to help people quit smoking.</p>
<p>The local ban was first requested by the Youth Advocacy Committee, a group of Marin County high-school students working to reduce teen smoking, vaping and nicotine use. The group is also working to ban the sale of tobacco products in Ross; the Town Council there is scheduled consider a proposal Nov. 13, the city’s Planning and Building Director Roberta Feliciano said in mid-October.</p>
<p>The county is also taking action. The Marin Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Oct. 21 to approve a ban on vaping devices for nicotine and minimum pricing for all other tobacco products in unincorporated areas. That includes a $12 minimum for a 20-pack of cigarettes plus $2 for each additional cigarette, with an automatic $1 increase every two years.</p>
<p>A required second vote for adoption is tentatively scheduled for Nov. 18 and would take effect 30 days later, with enforcement beginning Sept. 1, 2026.</p>]]></content:encoded>
