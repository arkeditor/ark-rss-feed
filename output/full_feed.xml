     <title>Tiburon rejects 8 of 9 grand jury critiques on housing</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-rejects-8-of-9-grand-jury-critiques-on-housing</link>
     <description>Tiburon officials agreed with only one of nine findings in a Marin grand jury report on housing mandates, following Belvedere&apos;s lead.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon officials agreed with only one of nine findings in a Marin civil grand jury report that criticized local jurisdictions for not doing enough to meet state housing mandates, following Belvedere’s lead from earlier this month.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously Sept. 16 to approve its formal response to the grand jury’s June report titled “The Worrisome Future of Marin Housing,” which will be signed and returned by Town Manager Greg Chanis. The Marin Board of Supervisors, Tiburon and the county’s 10 other incorporated municipalities were required to respond by Sept. 24.</p>
<p>The grand jury report blames “economic reality” rather than local resistance in asserting that all Marin jurisdictions, including Tiburon, will fall short of meeting state housing mandates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounter: A photographer’s second act after leaving TV behind</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounter-a-photographer-s-second-act-after-leaving-tv-behind</link>
     <description>Arthur Drooker, 71, left three-decade TV career at 50 after father&apos;s death to pursue photography.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At 50, Arthur Drooker’s life took a dramatic turn. His father had recently died, and his three-decade career as a Los Angeles TV writer and producer was getting stale. He longed for something deeper.</p>
<p>Dooker says his next choice was the best decision he ever made.</p>
<p>“I realized if there’s anything I really want to do with my life, I’ve got to do it now,” says Drooker, who stopped to chat Sept. 17 while on a bike ride at Shoreline Park. “And I was always a very self-motivated guy, but I was even more motivated now. And that’s when I decided, ‘What makes me happy?’”</p>
<p>For Drooker, now 71, the answer was photography.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Rose Marie ‘Posie’ Anderson</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/rose-marie-posie-anderson</link>
     <description>Rose Marie “Posie” Anderson died July 28, 2025.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rose Marie “Posie” Anderson will be remembered for her kindness, generosity, and dedication to her family and friends. Her life was marked by her devotion to classical piano music and her love of all things beautiful. She was well-known as a dynamic member of the Marin community, where she lived and taught piano lessons in her home for more than 50 years. She also served as the organist for the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Belvedere, where she was a long-time member.</p>
<p>Posie was born Rose Marie Reed on June 22, 1933, in Springfield, Missouri, where she grew up and attended Southwest Missouri State University and earned a bachelor’s degree in music. She married William “Bill” Boyd, and the young couple moved to California and started a family with a daughter, Becky and a son, Brett.</p>
<p>Posie and Bill Boyd later divorced, and in 1980 she married Willard “Bill” Anderson of Belvedere. Poise and Bill enjoyed a fairytale marriage for nearly 37 years, sharing their love for each other and their passion for music and travel. Bill Anderson passed away in 2017 at the age of 99.</p>
<p>Posie passed away peacefully in the presence of family on July 8, 2025, and is survived by her daughter, Becky Boyd; her son, Brett Boyd; daughter in-law Odette Boyd; and grandsons Max Boyd and Blake Boyd. A Celebration of Life will be held in her remembrance on October 4, 2025, at 1 PM at Marin Covenant Church, 195 N. Redwood Drive, San Rafael, CA.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Late actor, filmmaker Robert Redford had long ties to Tiburon</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/late-actor-filmmaker-robert-redford-had-long-ties-to-tiburon</link>
     <description>Robert Redford lived on Tiburon&apos;s Ridge Road in the late 1990s and early 2000s, returning to Mar East Street from 2020 to 2024.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To his Tiburon friends and neighbors, late Hollywood legend Robert Redford was simply “Bob” — the friendly guy who loved dogs, jogged around town and would strike up conversations about where people were from, never mentioning his own storied career.</p>
<p>“That is how we always knew him,” said resident Jeff Turnbaugh, who met Redford during walks around town. “It never came up that he was Robert Redford, and I never, ever asked anything about it — and obviously I knew.”</p>
<p>Redford, who died at his Utah home Sept. 16 at age 89, had local ties dating back some six decades. Dad Charles Redford Sr., who retired as an accounting manager for Chevron’s oil refinery in Richmond, lived in Tiburon from the early 1970s until his death in 1991.</p>
<p>Redford himself lived on Ridge Road in the late 1990s and early 2000s before moving to Calistoga and St. Helena. With artist wife Sibylle Szaggars Redford, he returned to Mar East Street in 2020 before relocating to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 2024, where she has an art gallery and together they ran an arts nonprofit promoting global conservation efforts.</p>
<p>The actor and Academy Award-winning director became one of Hollywood’s leading men in the 1960s and 1970s with starring roles in films like “The Candidate,” “Jeremiah Johnson,” “The Natural,” “The Sting,” and “All the President’s Men,” which is being screened Sept. 24-28 at Cinelounge in downtown Tiburon in honor of Redford.</p>
<p>He won an Oscar in 1981 for directing “Ordinary People,” which also won best picture that year, and received another nomination for “Quiz Show” in 1995. “The Sting” earned him a best-actor Academy Award nomination in 1974.</p>
<p>Redford’s impact extended beyond acting and directing. He founded the nonprofit Sundance Institute in 1981, which runs the Sundance Film Festival, the largest independent film festival in the U.S. Films like “American Psycho,” “Napoleon Dynamite,” “Whiplash” and “CODA,” which won the Oscar for best picture, have all premiered at Sundance.</p>
<p>Local connections span decades</p>
<p>Charles Robert Redford Jr. was born Aug. 18, 1936, in Santa Monica. Though he grew up in California, he became rooted in Utah after marrying historian and activist Lola Van Wagenen in 1958, later calling Los Angeles phony and superficial. They had four children — the eldest died of whom died at 2½ months — and divorced in 1985.</p>
<p>Redford’s most recent stay in Tiburon came during a difficult period for his family. He and ...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere officials are pushing back against a Marin civil grand jury report that criticizes local jurisdictions for failing to meet state housing goals, with Mayor Jane Cooper calling it a “one-size-fits-all” approach that ignores the city’s unique circumstances.</p>
<p>In a 4-0 vote Sept. 8, the City Council approved a formal response that disputed six of nine findings in the grand jury’s June report titled “The Worrisome Future of Marin Housing.” The legally required response will be signed by Cooper and returned to the grand jury.</p>
<p>“One of the most problematic issues with (the California Department of Housing and Community Development) that we face in Marin is their one-size-fits-all laws for everyone, no matter the size of the community or amount of land,” Cooper said at the meeting. “And now the grand jury is doing the same thing without regard for the individual differences, with statements such as ‘all Marin cities and towns should.’”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Richardson Bay’s few remaining anchor-outs may have lost their chance at subsidized onshore housing after the agency that manages the bay put its rental assistance program on hold.</p>
<p>The Marin Housing Authority in May asked the Richardson Bay Regional Agency to stop accepting applicants into its temporary-support housing program, saying it could no longer offer the federal vouchers meant to provide long-term rental assistance.</p>
<p>“We do not have the vouchers to proceed with the remaining people on the anchorage,” said Marin Housing Authority Executive Director Kimberly Carroll, citing “budget issues with the federal government.”</p>
<p>The request became public last week as part of the agency board’s Sept. 11 meeting.</p>
<p>The agency program, funded by a $3 million state grant, provides temporary one-year housing vouchers to anchor-outs living on boats on Richardson Bay who wish to move ashore. The program has been key to clearing derelict boats off the bay.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon fire officials adopt $16.7-million budget with funds for construction, upgrades</title>

     <description>Board adopts spending plan as construction begins on Paradise Drive fire station replacement.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Fire Protection District adopted a $16.7 million budget for fiscal 2025-2026 that includes $3.6 million toward the remodel of its Paradise Drive station, where construction began earlier this month. The budget also includes repairs and upgrades to the district’s downtown station.</p>
<p>The district’s board of directors voted 4-0 at its Sept. 10 meeting to approve the break-even budget, with board member Cheryl Woodford absent. The budget showed minimal changes from a preliminary budget approved in June, ahead of the July 1 start of the new fiscal year.</p>
<p>The remodel of Station 10 on Paradise Drive at Trestle Glen Boulevard accounts for about 22% of the district’s total anticipated expenditures in fiscal 2026. The project has been in the works for several years. The station was originally built in the 1960s as a two-stall facility for volunteer firefighters and has since expanded to about 4,000 square feet to include living quarters for on-duty staff and additional fire apparatus.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Medical professionals from New Hampshire and Southern California discover friendship in Marin.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>San Rafael resident Janessa Bowen (left) and new Tiburon resident Hannah Cashman have known each other for 2½ years, meeting through their jobs as an ultrasound technician and an X-ray technician, respectively.</p>
<p>Hannah Cashman says she’s enjoying her new stomping grounds after moving to Tiburon from Novato about three weeks ago.</p>
<p>She says she’s been enjoying the views and that she can walk to downtown from her new residence.</p>
<p>“I liked the aspect of being close to the city because I grew up in such a small town in New Hampshire that this is so big for me, and I love it,” Cashman says. “I love the outdoor life, but then I can also cross that bridge and have that city life.”</p>
<p>Cashman was hanging out with friend and San Rafael resident Janessa Bowen at Shoreline Park on Sept. 9. The two have known each other for roughly 2½ years through their work; Cashman is an X-ray technician, and Bowen is an ultrasound technician.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Artists convey emotions, thoughts in latest Belvedere-Tiburon Library exhibit</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/artists-convey-emotions-thoughts-in-latest-belvedere-tiburon-library-exhibit</link>
     <description>&apos;Interpretations&apos; features abstracts from local and regional artists.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 60 artists will showcase works that convey their emotions, ideas and thoughts through visual elements in the latest Belvedere-Tiburon Library exhibit, “Interpretations: Color, Line, Form.”</p>
<p>The show runs Sept. 18-Nov. 14, with an artist’s reception 6-8 p.m. Sept. 18.</p>
<p>“With non-representational art, artists aren’t going for verisimilitude,” says Diane Green, the library’s art committee co-chair. “Their art is more of an internal dialogue captured through the creative process. And the immediacy of a show like this is how the artists reveal emotional states through their medium of choice.”</p>
<p>Among the 58 artists contributing works to the show is Tiburon’s Anki Gelb with “Shoreline Waves.”</p>
<p>Though she prefers to work with oils, the piece is an acrylic on board and is one of five in a series titled “Coastal Fragments.”</p>
<p>“My inspiration for this collection is the rugged coastline of Big Sur, where the Pacific meets California’s wild edges,” says Gelb, 68. “It reflects the ocean’s quiet intensity and calm power.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Local Tiburon Band brings classic rock hits to charity events and community gatherings</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/local-tiburon-band-brings-classic-rock-hits-to-charity-events-and-community-gatherings</link>
     <description>From jam sessions to center stage.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six Tiburon Peninsula residents have discovered that forming a rock cover band offers more than just musical expression — it’s become a cornerstone of community connection.</p>
<p>Local Tiburon Band, a classic rock cover group, has evolved from casual jam sessions into a regular fixture at area venues and charity events. The six-member ensemble recently headlined the fourth annual Scotty Lapp Foundation Event on Sept. 12, helping raise nearly $100,000 for youth sports programs.</p>
<p>The charity performance represents the band’s community-focused approach to rock music. It began playing in 2022 with small shows on the dock of Sam’s Anchor Cafe. Since then, the group has grown into a regular act at the Sausalito Cruising Club and played to a packed downtown street during Tiburon’s Friday Nights on Main.</p>
<p>Local Tiburon Band brings together musicians from varied professional backgrounds: Peter Gillespie, executive director of Tokyo-based financial services group Nomura, on lead guitar; Jennings on drums; Rob Acker, CEO of HUBBL technologies, on guitar, piano and vocals; Nick Agrawal, who works for Salesforce, on guitar and vocals; attorney Joleen Lenihan on vocals; and Tim Baker on bass.</p>
<p>“What I love doing is playing for friends,” said Acker. “It’s an excuse to throw a party and have fun.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere sets strict path to undo historic home designation</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-sets-strict-path-to-undo-historic-home-designation</link>
     <description>Tax-break loss sparks debate over fairness and preservation.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere residents who own historic homes can now request the designation be removed — but in most cases, they’ll have to win approval from two city boards and pay a fee.</p>
<p>The City Council voted 4-0 on Sept. 8, with member Peter Mark absent, to add a new chapter to the city’s municipal code creating a process to decertify historic homes. Councilmembers agreed they generally wanted that process to be a strict one, given the importance the city has placed on protecting historic and architecturally significant homes.</p>
<p>“From my perspective, the historic homes help make Belvedere what it is,” said Mayor Jane Cooper. “We’re all very proud of the homes and how they add to the community and the city and the history involved with them. And people certainly appreciate them and cherish them.”</p>
<p>The council will conduct a second, required reading and vote on the ordinance at its Oct. 13 meeting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Traffic agency, Belvedere back bike-lane removal in Caltrans’ final draft</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/traffic-agency-belvedere-back-bike-lane-removal-in-caltrans-final-draft</link>
     <description>Cyclists show school buses skip stops, fit in others, undermining safety claims.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local agencies are endorsing Caltrans’ latest design plans that remove contentious bike lanes from next summer’s Tiburon Boulevard maintenance project, citing school-bus safety concerns. But cycling advocates are disputing those claims with field observations showing buses are skipping supposedly “critical” stops, picking up outside proposed lane areas and operating safely in similar conditions elsewhere.</p>
<p>Caltrans spokesperson Matt O’Donnell confirmed Sept. 11 that the new design plans postpone construction of proposed bike-lane segments between Blackfield Drive and Trestle Glen Boulevard from Phase 1 of the 4.6-mile, $15-million project to an as-yet-unfunded second phase. This follows suggestions in a July 22 internal document obtained and previously reported by The Ark.</p>
<p>The yearlong project, set to start in summer 2026, spans state-owned Highway 131 from Mill Valley to Tiburon’s Main Street.</p>
<p>The new plans restore a multiuse path to East Strawberry Drive and include broadband-conduit installation in Phase 1. They represent an end-stage draft before final construction plans are created. Those are expected this month, O’Donnell said.</p>
<p>The Tiburon Peninsula Traffic Alliance, which operates the bus program for Tiburon schools, and Belvedere City Council approved letters last week supporting the final draft. Reed Union School District Superintendent Kimberly McGrath also continued to back the removal of the lanes for student-safety reasons.</p>
<p>However, bicycle advocacy groups WTB-TAM and the Marin County Bicycle Coalition jointly submitted their own letter criticizing Caltrans for backing out while challenging the safety rationale behind the revisions.</p>
<p>Observations challenge safety claims</p>
<p>With school back in session, WTB-TAM observed Reed Elementary School’s morning bus route skip the scheduled inbound Cecilia Way stop on Aug. 29 and Sept. 5. The traffic alliance claims this stop is critical to operations and would be eliminated by bus provider First Student under its safety policies if the bike lane were installed. The Ark also observed the same bus route drive past the Cecilia Way stop Sept. 12.</p>
<p>WTB-TAM also noted the actual site of a second critical inbound stop at Blackie’s Pasture sits beyond where the bike lanes were planned to end in previous design iterations, eliminating another potential conflict.</p>
<p>The traffic alliance has said First Student won’t serve a bus stop that blocks a bike lane an...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>A diagram from bicycle advocacy group WTB-TAM shows measurements at the inbound 76 gas station school-bus stop on Tiburon Boulevard, documenting 22 feet between the curb and vehicle travel lane. A standard school bus is 8½ feet wide. The cycling advocates argue there’s sufficient space for school buses to load students at the sidewalk without blocking proposed bike lanes, challenging claims from the Tiburon Peninsula Traffic Alliance bus program that the lanes would create safety conflicts that either force kids to load in the lanes or block lanes and force cyclists into traffic.

     <title>From law to landscapes, Belvedere artist finds first solo stage in Big Apple</title>

     <description>al real estate analyst&apos;s 2010 painting class gift from wife leads to debut solo show.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his late 30s, commercial real-estate analyst Brian Higgins received an unexpected Christmas gift from his wife: A painting class.</p>
<p>Higgins had long worked with what he calls his “analytical” mind, first earning a law degree from the University of California College of the Law at San Francisco, then called UC Hastings, in the 1990s, then building a career in commercial real estate. The introduction to painting class, he says, awakened something he’d lost long ago.</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, the Belvedere resident has landed his first solo art exhibition. “Ascend: The Evolution of Identity” will be held Sept. 30-Oct. 11 at the Alessandro Berni Gallery in New York City. Beyond a collection of his impressionism-meets-abstraction paintings, the exhibition will also feature a live painting performance, during which Higgins will create a full piece before an audience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Zand says her life is a balance of two sides of her mind: the practical, analytical side that grounds her work as a pharmacist at the Tiburon Boulevard CVS/pharmacy — her “medicine side” she says — and the holistic, intuition-based side that inspires her passion for sound-bath healing by night — “my more witchy side.”</p>
<p>“I tap into both sides,” she says. “I think they are both healing in different ways.”</p>]]></content:encoded>
