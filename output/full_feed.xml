     <title>Tiburon hires consultant to prepare for rising sea levels</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-hires-consultant-to-prepare-for-rising-sea-levels</link>
     <description>Tiburon will spend nearly $600,000 in state grant money to hire a consultant to plan how the town will address rising sea levels threatening its shorelines.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will spend nearly $600,000 in state grant money to hire a consultant to plan how the town will address rising sea levels threatening its shorelines.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted 3-0 Nov. 5 to approve a contract with multinational firm Moffatt and Nichol for the work, which will cost $593,877 using funds awarded in June by the California Ocean Protection Council.</p>
<p>All coastal jurisdictions are required to create a sea-level-rise vulnerability assessment and adaptation plan, known formally as a Subregional Shoreline Adaptation Plan, by 2034 under Senate Bill 272.</p>
<p>Grace Ledwith, Tiburon’s climate action and sustainability coordinator, said while the county has done various vulnerability assessments and sea-level rise studies, none covered town-specific vulnerabilities and assets.</p>
<p>“This will be a first-time effort really diving into our specific concerns,” Ledwith told councilmembers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon officer charged with DUI, child cruelty, pleads not guilty</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-officer-charged-with-dui-child-cruelty-pleads-not-guilty</link>
     <description>Tiburon police officer William Forrest Condit has pleaded not guilty to one count of misdemeanor child cruelty and two counts of misdemeanor drunken driving.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon police officer William Forrest Condit has pleaded not guilty to one count of misdemeanor child cruelty and two counts of misdemeanor drunken driving following his Oct. 13 arrest near downtown Petaluma. Both DUI counts carry sentencing-enhancement requests for endangerment of a child passenger.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old Sebastopol resident entered the plea in Sonoma County Superior Court Nov. 10. The county District Attorney’s Office formally filed the charges Nov. 5.</p>
<p>Condit has been with the Tiburon Police Department since 2019 and was placed on administrative leave following his arrest, Chief Michelle Jean said last month. He was off duty when Petaluma police conducted a traffic stop after observing indications of impaired driving, authorities said.</p>
<p>Petaluma police and the District Attorney’s Office both declined to comment on further details, including Condit’s relationship to the child, his blood-alcohol level or how it was measured.</p>
<p>The DUI charges are for driving under the influence of alcohol and for driving with a blood-alcohol content exceeding 0.08%, California’s legal maximum for those 21 and older.</p>
<p>If convicted, Condit could face up to six months in jail, more than $10,000 in fines after penalty assessments, suspension of his driver’s license and probation. The child-endangerment enhancements each carry an additional mandatory 48 hours in jail.</p>
<p>Under state law, a defendant can be charged with but not convicted of both the endangerment enhancements and the child-cruelty charge for the same incident.</p>
<p>If convicted of the cruelty charge instead, Condit could face an additional one year in jail, another $5,000 in fines after penalties, mandatory probation of at least four years and a mandatory criminal protective order.</p>
<p>Jean said Oct. 20 that the town is reviewing the case with an independent investigator to determine whether any department policies were violated.</p>
<p>“Pending the results of both the criminal investigation and administrative review, (we) will take appropriate action that reflects the values of the department,” she said.</p>
<p>Jean did not respond to requests for comment after the charges were filed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: An aspiring actor encourages others to follow their dreams</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-an-aspiring-actor-encourages-others-to-follow-their-dreams</link>
     <description>The 31-year-old Tiburon resident from Tijuana, Mexico, is recently secured her first paid gig in Los Angeles.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karen Gomez says she’s wanted to be an actor since she was a kid.</p>
<p>Now, the 31-year-old Tiburon resident from Tijuana, Mexico, is making progress toward that goal. She recently secured her first paid gig in Los Angeles — something both exciting and macabre: Gomez played a zombie for an ad that will appear on TikTok.</p>
<p>“It makes me feel like this dream was always possible, and that you, me and all of us have the ability to do it,” Gomez says in an interview conducted in Spanish as she sat on the banks near the Railroad Marsh Nov. 4. “It’s a matter of focus or, rather, truly following your dreams. I believe when you’ve got clarity on what you want, you’ll accomplish it.”</p>
<p>Gomez says she’s always loved to write and sing. Her mother shares those creative impulses, she says, taking pictures, reading and writing. Gomez remembers watching her mom do dubbing work as part of her university studies, an experience that wowed the young girl.</p>
<p>“I feel I got that from her,” Gomez says of her mom’s artistic interests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Mahjong’s moment: Local classes draw all ages as tactile, social game sees surge in popularity</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/mahjong-s-moment</link>
     <description>Throughout the Tiburon Peninsula — offered by the Belvedere-Tiburon Library, Strawberry Recreation District and The Ranch — mahjong classes are exploding in popularity.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twelve-year-old Strawberry resident Julien Letard leans over 144 mahjong tiles spread on the table at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library Nov. 4. A lollipop hangs from his mouth as he moves the tiles — decorated with dragons, flowers and Chinese characters — from the mahjong wall to his rack. The room is quiet except for the click and clack of tiles and Letard’s voice as he teaches novice adults how to play.</p>
<p>The scene is far from the centuries-old Chinese game’s origins with Asian elders, but it reflects a growing national trend. Mahjong is having a moment, increasingly found in bars, restaurants and public spaces as people seek real-world social interaction after the pandemic. Mahjong events in the U.S. jumped 179% between 2023 and 2024, according to Eventbrite.</p>
<p>Throughout the Tiburon Peninsula — offered by the Belvedere-Tiburon Library, Strawberry Recreation District and The Ranch — mahjong classes are exploding in popularity. Residents of all ages are catching on, finding community and competition amid clacking tiles.</p>
<p>The Ranch, Tiburon and Belvedere’s joint recreation agency, has held seven beginner mahjong course series since late 2024. Strawberry Rec began its own beginner classes in October. The library launched Tuesday-night open play sessions in August. Both The Ranch and Strawberry Rec plan to start new open-play sessions in early 2026.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Strawberry senior-housing project enters 60-day fast-track review</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-senior-housing-project-enters-60-day-fast-track-review</link>
     <description>Marin County planners deemed complete the application for a 106-unit senior-living facility on Strawberry’s North Knoll Road on Nov. 6.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marin County planners deemed complete the application for a 106-unit senior-living facility on Strawberry’s North Knoll Road on Nov. 6, starting a 60-day timeline that could see the project approved by Jan. 4 despite fierce opposition from neighbors.</p>
<p>The finding by the county’s Community Development Agency triggered the ministerial-review period for the Spirit Living Group project, a streamlining process that requires the 150,655-square-foot facility to meet objective standards but does not allow for public hearings or subjective judgment.</p>
<p>The county must first complete a 30-day consistency analysis, due by Dec. 6, to determine whether the proposal conforms to local code requirements such as the number of stories, height and setback standards, Senior Planner Megan Alton said last week. The project is eligible for waivers to ensure it can be built to capacity, and the developer is seeking to exceed the allowed number of stories and maximum lot coverage.</p>
<p>Alton said the consistency analysis will be made public. If the code requirements are met, the county must approve the project by Jan. 4, allowing Spirit Living to apply for building permits. If there are any inconsistencies not covered by the waiver request, the developers can modify that request by the approval deadline or face denial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon sirens may sound Nov. 13 after residents couldn’t hear drill alert</title>

     <description>Tiburon’s emergency sirens may sound intermittently between 10 a.m. and noon Nov. 13 as crews perform maintenance.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon’s emergency sirens may sound intermittently between 10 a.m. and noon Nov. 13 as crews perform maintenance in response to residents reporting they couldn’t hear the sirens during last month’s statewide Great ShakeOut earthquake drill.</p>
<p>“We’re just trying to check and make sure everything is working properly,” Emergency Services Coordinator Laurie Nilsen of the Tiburon Police Department said.</p>
<p>She said the maintenance will be conducted on four of the town’s five sirens — those at the downtown Tiburon Boulevard fire station, Del Mar Middle School, the Tiburon Corporation Yard behind Reed Elementary and the Paradise Cove treatment plant near Paradise Beach Park.</p>
<p>A fifth siren at the Paradise Drive fire station is temporarily offline during construction of the new facility, Nilsen said.</p>
<p>The maintenance work is separate from the town’s regular 15-second emergency siren tests at noon Saturdays.</p>
<p>Nilsen encouraged residents to stay informed about emergencies by signing up for alerts atalertmarin.org. Residents who hear sirens during non-test periods should seek emergency information atemergency.marincounty.gov, municipal websites or by tuning to 840 AM radio.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon bans all sales of tobacco in first U.S. law with no exemptions</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-bans-all-sales-of-tobacco-in-first-u-s-law-with-no-exemptions</link>
     <description>Tiburon joins Manhattan Beach and Beverly Hills in banning tobacco sales, but the laws in the two Southern California cities allow for exceptions.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon has become the first city in the nation to ban all tobacco sales without exemptions.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted 4-0, with Vice Mayor Jon Welner absent, at its Nov. 5 meeting to formally adopt the ordinanceafter approving it Oct. 15. The ban is set to take effect Dec. 5.</p>
<p>The new law has little practical effect, as no businesses within town limits sell tobacco: CVS stopped selling tobacco nationwide in 2014, and the Tiburon Boulevard gas stations are in unincorporated Marin.</p>
<p>Tiburon joins Manhattan Beach and Beverly Hills in banning tobacco sales, but the laws in the two Southern California cities allow for exceptions. Beverly Hills allows hotels to sell to guests, and Manhattan Beach includes a hardship exemption for businesses.</p>
<p>Tiburon’s law does not apply to Food and Drug Administration-authorized products intended to help people quit smoking.</p>
<p>The local ban was first requested by the Youth Advocacy Committee, a group of Marin County high-school students working to reduce teen smoking, vaping and nicotine use. The group is also working to ban the sale of tobacco products in Ross; the Town Council there is scheduled consider a proposal Nov. 13, the city’s Planning and Building Director Roberta Feliciano said in mid-October.</p>
<p>The county is also taking action. The Marin Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Oct. 21 to approve a ban on vaping devices for nicotine and minimum pricing for all other tobacco products in unincorporated areas. That includes a $12 minimum for a 20-pack of cigarettes plus $2 for each additional cigarette, with an automatic $1 increase every two years.</p>
<p>A required second vote for adoption is tentatively scheduled for Nov. 18 and would take effect 30 days later, with enforcement beginning Sept. 1, 2026.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon Peninsula voters back Prop. 50 to redraw California congressional districts for Democrats</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-peninsula-voters-back-prop-50-to-redraw-california-congressional-districts-for-democrats</link>
     <description>Some 74.9% of Tiburon voters supported the proposition, compared with 66.3% of Belvedere voters, as of 10:45 p.m. Nov. 4.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon Peninsula voters joined the rest of California in overwhelmingly approving efforts to temporarily redraw the state’s U.S. House districts in favor of Democrats. The measure seeks to counter Republican gerrymandering in Texas and other states.</p>
<p>Proposition 50 keeps the peninsula in the 2nd Congressional District but dramatically expands its boundaries to include Republican strongholds near the Oregon border. The measure had 63.8% statewide support as of midmorning Nov. 5, with 80.6% of Marin voters backing the initiative.</p>
<p>The Associated Press called the election shortly after polls closed Nov. 4.</p>
<p>Some 74.9% of Tiburon voters supported the proposition, compared with 66.3% of Belvedere voters, as of 10:45 p.m. Nov. 4. A precinct covering unincorporated areas representing all of unincorporated Tiburon and southern Strawberry has 77.8% of voters backing the initiative.</p>
<p>Statewide turnout was about 35% compared with 47% for Marin and the unincorporated peninsula, 46% for Belvedere and 45% for Tiburon.</p>
<p>Marin’s next results update is scheduled for no later than 5 p.m. Nov. 7, officials said. Results will be certified Dec. 2.</p>
<p>The measure was the only item on the ballot for peninsula voters. It creates opportunities for Democrats to gain up to five congressional seats statewide as part of the Election Rigging Response Act, the law Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in August that led to the ballot initiative in response to redistricting in Texas that would give Republicans an advantage in the 2026 midterm elections.</p>
<p>Sacramento-based Redistricting Partners, the consultant hired by congressional Democrats, drew the maps, which will be in effect for 2026. They’ll remain in place for the 2028 and 2030 elections before reverting to census-based lines drawn by California’s independent Citizen Redistricting Commission.</p>
<p>The California Republican Party and others filed a lawsuit Nov. 5 arguing the new maps are unconstitutional. They allege the maps were drawn to increase the voting power of a racial group, specifically Hispanic voters.</p>
<p>Proposition 50, which does not impact state Assembly or Senate districts, also includes language calling on Congress to pass federal legislation requiring the use of independent nonpartisan redistricting commissions nationwide.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, a San Rafael Democrat who has represented the 2nd District since 2013 and has expressed support for the measure, w...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tartine bakery sets sights on spring debut at Strawberry Village</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tartine-bakery-sets-sights-on-spring-debut-at-strawberry-village</link>
     <description>Construction was to begin before year’s end, according to Tartine CEO Dar Vasseghi.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Award-winning bakery Tartine is targeting a spring opening for its long-awaited Strawberry Village shopping center expansion, with construction to begin before year’s end, according to CEO Dar Vasseghi.</p>
<p>Tartine announced in March that it had chosen Strawberry for its first North Bay location, meaning residents will no long­er have to drive into San Francisco — or brave the notorious hourlong lines — for the bakery’s acclaimed sourdough, pastries and lunch items including seasonal quiches, omelets, smoked salmon and avocado tartines and hearty salads.</p>
<p>While representatives for Edens, the real-estate developer that owns the center, initially said the bakery would open in 2025, Vasseghi said last week the new target date is spring 2026, though he couldn’t provide more specifics.</p>
<p>Tartine, which has two San Francisco locations and six each in Los Angeles and Seoul, South Korea, will occupy 3,091 square feet across two long-vacant storefronts in the same cluster as Safeway, Calico Corners and High Tech Burrito, and across from Rims & Goggles.</p>
<p>The space will blend with the rest of the shopping center, Vasseghi said. San Francisco firm Studio BBA designed the space to incorporate the shopping center’s Mediterranean aesthetic with a large, open layout and high ceilings. Customers will be able to watch the bakers work.</p>
<p>The Marin location marks a return to Tartine’s roots: Husband-and-wife team Chad Robertson and Liz Prueitt first honed their craft with Wood-Fire Baking in Point Reyes, then launched Bay Village Breads in Mill Valley in 1999. They left Mill Valley for San Francisco in 2002 to open their first Tartine location in the city’s Mission district, where long lines formed each morning as customers reserved bread three days ahead.</p>
<p>In 2008, they won the James Beard Foundation Award as the best pastry chefs in America, and Bon Appétit magazine called Tartine “America’s most influential bakery” in 2017.</p>
<p>Vasseghi said he believes the Strawberry Village location will be a popular one.</p>
<p>“I think that the quality of the product is something people will welcome,” he said. “I think a warm environment where they can come and hang out and enjoy their product, they will welcome.”</p>

     <title>Marin restores key flood pump after months of setbacks from supply chain</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/marin-restores-key-flood-pump-after-months-of-setbacks-from-supply-chain</link>
     <description>The first of the season’s king tides, which can cause roadway flooding in the area, was expected today, Nov. 5, alongside a 90% chance of rain.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>International supply-chain delays kept a critical Strawberry pump station offline for months, raising concerns about contingency plans amid extreme tidal events and the approaching rainy season, but the refurbished equipment finally returned to service last week.</p>
<p>Parts for the Strawberry Circle pump station arrived from Sweden Oct. 29 after a summer-long wait. Marin County senior civil engineer Hannah Lee, a staff liaison to the advisory board, confirmed the pump returned to service Oct. 31. The first of the season’s king tides, which can cause roadway flooding in the area, is expected today, Nov. 5, alongside a 90% chance of rain.</p>
<p>The delays were discussed Oct. 28 at a Marin Flood Control Zone 4 advisory board meeting, alongside updates on a restoration project for the East and West creeks and a study to address flooding at Greenwood Cove Drive. No formal votes were taken.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon arts commission turns to parks for feedback on street-sign exhibit</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-arts-commission-turns-to-parks-for-feedback-on-street-sign-exhibit</link>
     <description>Los Angeles artist Scott Froschauer&apos;s public-art proposal will go before the parks board Nov. 18.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After months of tweaking a proposal for public-art street signs that say “soar” instead of “stop” and “you are amazing” instead of “do not enter,” the Tiburon Heritage and Arts Commission is turning to the town’s parks board for input on whether the installation should move forward.</p>
<p>Commissioners voted unanimously at their Oct. 28 meeting to ask the Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission for feedback on Los Angeles-based artist Scott Froschauer’s “The Word on the Street” exhibit, which would place 10 signs in Zelinsky, South of the Knoll, Cypress Hollow and Teather parks.</p>
<p>The parks board is expected to take a look at the project at its Nov. 18 meeting.</p>
<p>“It is, after all, their domain: the parks,” arts commission Chair Arjun Gupta said. “They know it well, they know what goes in and what comes out, and I’d love to hear from them what their thoughts are before we make any further moves on this project.”</p>
<p>If the arts board decides to back the project after weighing the parks commission’s feedback, it would return to the parks board for a formal recommendation and ultimately to the Town Council for final approval.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Cinelounge Tiburon plans to bring vertical movies to big screen</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/cinelounge-tiburon-plans-to-bring-vertical-movies-to-big-screen</link>
     <description>Submissions for the inaugural Marin Vertical Film Festival opened Nov. 4 and run through June, with the festival scheduled for next October.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Movies made for smartphones will fill a movie-theater screen in Tiburon next fall when Cinelounge hosts the inaugural Marin Vertical Film Festival.</p>
<p>Christian and Camilla Meoli, who own the downtown theater and live in town, have created the festival to showcase films shot in the vertical 9:16 aspect ratio designed for mobile devices. Submissions were set to open Nov. 4, after The Ark’s press time, viafilmfreeway.com. They’ll close in June 2026, and the festival is scheduled for Oct. 1-5, 2026.</p>
<p>Christian Meoli says the vertical-film festival is the first of five or six the theater, at 40 Main St., hopes to host next year. He says his goal is to bring the event to theaters across Marin.</p>
<p>“It will be a film festival that really embraces all the towns in Marin and really showcases a tremendous amount of new and young filmmakers, which is the point,” he says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon resident looks to assess well-being with ‘vitality index’</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-resident-looks-to-assess-well-being-with-vitality-index</link>
     <description>Factors can be anything from how a person perceives their relationships with others and how healthy they feel to their environmental stewardship or creative pursuits.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Tiburon resident Jim Lavelle thinks about living well, he remembers his grandmother Mary.</p>
<p>She built a home in Belvedere in 1951 and lived to be 99 years old. As health-conscious eater and keen fitness practitioner, she worked out to videos made by fitness pioneer Jack LaLanne and swam at her local YWCA well into her 80s.</p>
<p>She inspired Lavelle, now 74, to pursue health — something he says has become easier with advances in modern science.</p>
<p>“But, on the other hand, there’s a difference between living a long time and living your best life for as long as you can — because you can be healthy and still be miserable,” the Tiburon resident says.</p>
<p>That distinction led Lavelle to create the Vitality Index and Rating, a 100-point scale on which people can determine their vitality score by identifying the 10 most important traits or factors in their life and scoring each from one to 10. Those scores are added up for an overall rating.</p>
<p>Factors can be anything from how a person perceives their relationships with others and how healthy they feel to their environmental stewardship or creative pursuits, Lavelle says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sebastian Rivas has built a successful career in real-estate investing, but he says he’s ready for a change.</p>
<p>“I want to be a cop,” says Rivas, a Tiburon resident who was walking his dogs, Rodeo and Farallon, at Shoreline Park Oct. 29.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old called the potential career change “kind of wild,” but noted he’s already taken the first steps by passing a written exam with the San Francisco Police Department. Next comes a physical test, an extensive background check and basic police academy, followed hopefully by a police job in San Francisco.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Richard Charles Otter: September 13, 1933 – October 25, 2025.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Richard Charles Otter (September 13, 1933 – October 25, 2025) passed away peacefully, surrounded by family, in his home in Hillsborough, California. Throughout his incredible 92 years, Dick was remarkable in his ability to forge new connections and lifelong friendships. Whether aboard the Tiburon Ferry exchanging stories with neighbors, sharing laughs around a domino table, meeting prospective clients in his office, or offering thoughtful counsel at a board meeting, Dick’s warm smile and sparkling personality created genuine bonds with effortless ease, well into his ninth decade.</p>
<p>He was a seventh generation San Franciscan; tracing his ancestry to the late 18th century when his Spanish forebears came to California from Mexico. As his father was the manager of the Yosemite Lodge for decades, his childhood was split between Berkeley and the iconic Yosemite Valley. Spending his summers each year in the valley, Dick developed lifelong bonds to every aspect of that amazing place. Those links led to his eventually serving as chairman of the Yosemite Fund (now Yosemite Conservancy). He also served as the chair of the Save the Redwood League and on the board for more than 30 years — over which time he reviewed more than 200 acquisitions and 73,000 acres of California redwood forest. His connection to Yosemite also led to his serving as a founding member of the new University of California, Merced Foundation, the newest in the UC system, founded in 2005.</p>
<p>Dick was a proud Cal Bear, enrolling in UC Berkeley after graduating from Berkeley High. He was a member of Theta Chi fraternity. After college, Dick served in the United States Marine Corps, flying helicopters in Asia between the Korean and Vietnam wars.</p>
<p>Professionally, Dick would proudly describe himself as “just a stockbroker.” However, his modest description did not fully capture the role he played in creating and protecting wealth for his legions of loyal clients. He joined the famed San Francisco investment firm Davis, Skaggs & Co. in 1960 and retired 65 years later after that firm eventually transformed itself into Morgan Stanley. He famously never changed jobs — just the company name on the business card was frequently updated. Dick’s understanding of world markets was the product of lifelong curiosity and careful study of financial, economic, and political trends. He also shared his knowledge as an instructor of investments and economics at the College of Marin.</p>

     <title>Travel Bug: Exploring the high country offers fresh approach to Yosemite</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/travel-bug-exploring-the-high-country-offers-fresh-approach-to-yosemite</link>
     <description>Over the past three years, I have been questioning whether Yosemite was worth the frustration.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, our family visited Yosemite regularly, camping under canvas, staying in tent cabins and hiking between the High Sierra Camps. During off-peak months, we booked rooms at the Yosemite Valley Lodge. We once splurged on the Ahwahnee Hotel but found the experience underwhelming. Today, standard rooms at the Ahwahnee command $515 to $1,259 per night depending on seasonal demand, and reservations must be secured months in advance. Over the past three years, I’ve endured last-minute cancellations and struggled to secure any reservations at all. I began questioning whether Yosemite was worth the frustration.</p>
<p>Back in early August, before the federal shutdown, I decided to research alternative approaches to experiencing Yosemite’s high country — hopefully with fewer crowds and complications. I discovered three lodges near the Big Oak Flat entrance: Evergreen Lodge, Rush Creek Lodge and Blackberry Inn. We secured several mid-week nights at Evergreen Lodge without difficulty, drawn by its reputation for secluded, natural accommodations.</p>
<p>At Evergreen Lodge, I immediately began exploring the property, photographing the individual cabins, swimming pool, spa facilities and extensive recreational amenities. The 22-acre grounds house both traditional cabins and 22 luxury tents, scattered throughout the forested landscape to create an authentic wilderness experience. The lodge has become a sought-after wedding destination — staff informed us that every weekend through fall was completely booked with ceremonies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>I got to relax in a hammock at Evergreen Lodge, located near Yosemite’s Big Oak Flat entrance, which features traditional cabins and luxury tents, a pool, hot tub, play areas and bocce courts. The property provides a base for visitors exploring Olmsted Point — with its views of Half Dome — and less-crowded high-country destinations like May Lake and Tenaya Lake.

     <title>Neighbors threaten lawsuit over Strawberry senior-care project</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/neighbors-threaten-lawsuit-over-strawberry-senior-care-project</link>
     <description>The five-story, 150,655-square-foot building would house 106 units on a vacant lot at 70 N. Knoll Road, standing more than 60 feet tall.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fight is brewing over a senior-care facility planned for a Strawberry hillside, with neighbors threatening legal action and calling the project “absolutely, unequivocally insane.”</p>
<p>The five-story, 150,655-square-foot building would house 106 units on a vacant lot at 70 N. Knoll Road, standing more than 60 feet tall near homes in what residents describe as a semi-rural neighborhood. Marin County is moving forward with review and potential approval of the plan through a streamlining process that limits public input.</p>
<p>One local group led by Strawberry resident Scott Arwin said it is considering a lawsuit to block the facility. The group held a meeting at an Eagle Rock Road home Oct. 29 to organize opposition. Members cite safety risks for seniors, increased traffic, environmental concerns and the project’s poor fit with the area’s character, as well as noise, light and air-quality issues.</p>
<p>The developers — brothers Ali Shabahangi and Amir Kia of San Anselmo-based Spirit Living Group — submitted their latest application revision Oct. 6. The proposal includes 71 independent-living apartments and 35 assisted-living and memory-care suites on 3.7 acres of the 6.6-acre site, with the remaining acreage preserved as open space. The county is reviewing it and has until tomorrow, Nov. 6, to deem it complete or incomplete under the ministerial-review process.</p>
<p>“I just think it’s unfortunate that some neighbors are considering legal action against the project,” Shabahangi said in an interview. “It’s a project that I think addresses the lack of housing, particularly senior housing in the area. And we also understand that the state has established safeguards to prevent misuse of litigation to block housing. But our hope is that it doesn’t come to that.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere commission backs zoning changes for new housing</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-commission-backs-zoning-changes-for-new-housing</link>
     <description>The Planning Commission unanimously recommended zoning changes that would accommodate at least 160 new housing units</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By KEVIN HESSEL and TYLER CALLISTER</p>
<p>After nearly three years out of compliance with state housing requirements, Belvedere moved a step closer Oct. 21 when the Planning Commission unanimously recommended zoning changes that would accommodate at least 160 new housing units.</p>
<p>Both the revised housing element and related zoning amendments will go to the Belvedere City Council at its Nov. 10 meeting.</p>
<p>The move codifies changes the city made to its state-mandated housing element, which received tentative approval from the California Department of Housing and Community Development in July after three failed attempts.</p>
<p>Belvedere cannot be deemed compliant until all necessary rezoning matches the housing element. After City Council approval, the city will submit final versions to the state housing agency for certification.</p>
<p>The changes cover affordable-housing requirements and incentives, streamlined approval for developments with at least 20% affordable housing, design and development standards, mixed-use housing, emergency shelters, parking and reasonable-accommodation requests.</p>]]></content:encoded>
