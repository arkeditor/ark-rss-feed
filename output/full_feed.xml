     <title>Belvedere commission backs zoning changes for new housing</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-commission-backs-zoning-changes-for-new-housing</link>
     <description>The Planning Commission unanimously recommended zoning changes that would accommodate at least 160 new housing units</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By KEVIN HESSEL and TYLER CALLISTER</p>
<p>After nearly three years out of compliance with state housing requirements, Belvedere moved a step closer Oct. 21 when the Planning Commission unanimously recommended zoning changes that would accommodate at least 160 new housing units.</p>
<p>Both the revised housing element and related zoning amendments will go to the Belvedere City Council at its Nov. 10 meeting.</p>
<p>The move codifies changes the city made to its state-mandated housing element, which received tentative approval from the California Department of Housing and Community Development in July after three failed attempts.</p>
<p>Belvedere cannot be deemed compliant until all necessary rezoning matches the housing element. After City Council approval, the city will submit final versions to the state housing agency for certification.</p>
<p>The changes cover affordable-housing requirements and incentives, streamlined approval for developments with at least 20% affordable housing, design and development standards, mixed-use housing, emergency shelters, parking and reasonable-accommodation requests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/improvements-aim-to-protect-tiburon-students-and-rec-center-visitors</link>
     <description>Plans include new sidewalks, retaining walls and curb gutters; high-visibility crosswalks, yield lines and stencils; new signage; relocated fencing; and extending drainage culverts.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will add continuous sidewalks, high-visibility crosswalks and upgraded curb ramps along Kleinert Way to create safer routes for students walking to and from Reed Elementary School, the Belvedere Tiburon Child Care Center and The Ranch’s Dairy Knoll rec center.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously Oct. 15 to spend $144,715 for Parametrix Inc. to finalize designs for the pedestrian improvements. The Sausalito-based firm is also conducting a traffic study of Tiburon’s major thoroughfares.</p>
<p>Kleinert Way connects Ned’s Way and Lyford Drive and provides access to the Tiburon Police Department, child-care center, Reed Elementary and Tiburon corporation yard.

     <title>Documentary traces mountain lion&apos;s trek through Tiburon and beyond</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/documentary-traces-mountain-lion-s-trek-through-tiburon-and-beyond</link>
     <description>The film is streaming online through Oct. 30 as part of the 2025 Green Film Festival of San Francisco.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fairfax resident Amelie Bluestone had long been fascinated by mountain lions when she learned about P36, the juvenile male that visited the Tiburon Peninsula in 2023 during a 1,400-mile trek across the Bay Area.</p>
<p>“P36 is a great example of what mountain lions go through on a day-to-day basis, but he did travel a remarkable distance,” she says. “And that’s what made him stand out to me and what made his story so interesting.”</p>
<p>Bluestone directed “The Path of Puma-36,” a documentary short film that follows P36’s 17-month journey across Northern California while wearing a tracking collar as part of the Living with Lions project at Stinson Beach-based conservation nonprofit All Hands Ecology, founded as Audubon Canyon Ranch by late Belvedere conservationist Marty Griffin in 1962.</p>
<p>Bluestone’s film is streaming online through Oct. 30 as part of the 2025 Green Film Festival of San Francisco following a showing at San Francisco’s 4 Star Theater Oct. 25. She plans another screening in Fairfax in December, though details are still being worked out, and she also plans to make the documentary available online after she finishes the film-festival circuit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earlier this month, Tiburon police received a call reporting an “ongoing issue with boats continuing to use megaphones” in the area of Keil Cove, according to dispatch logs. Marin County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Adam Schermerhorn confirmed his office has also received a complaint.</p>
<p>Patricia Lakner, who lives on Mar East Street, said she regularly hears bullhorns from fishing-charter boats. She said at least four other neighbors also have complained.</p>
<p>“There are noise ordinances in effect practically everywhere that limit time and volume, and the bay should not be exempt,” she said by email. “Our complaint is not that there are fishing boats, but that they are unnecessarily loud, especially in the wee hours of the morning.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Funding for the design work was included as part of the town’s capital-improvement program for fiscal year 2025-2026. The streets, all of which need “light maintenance,” according to a staff report, were selected in April after a roads assessment conducted by the town and funded by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, which doles out money to jurisdictions every three years for the evaluations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Father-and-son Tiburon rowers share bond while tackling Boston’s iconic Head of the Charles</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/father-and-son-tiburon-rowers-share-bond-while-tackling-boston-s-iconic-head-of-the-charles</link>
     <description>The Tiburon father and son competed in the Directors’ Challenge Parent/Child Doubles race during the 2025 Head of the Charles Regatta.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Brian and Felix Davis, rowing is a family affair.</p>
<p>The Tiburon father and son competed in the Directors’ Challenge Parent/Child Doubles race during the 2025 Head of the Charles Regatta Oct. 19, the final day of the three-day annual regatta on the Charles River in Boston. The regatta is considered the largest in the sport by participants.</p>
<p>Both Davises row in eight-person sweeps in their respective age groups at the Greenbrae-based Marin Rowing Association, where they train six days a week. In sweeps, each rower uses a single oar while a ninth person serves as coxswain. Like father, like son: both row port side.</p>
<p>The parent-child race offered a unique opportunity for Brian and Felix to try sculling, where rowers propel the boat with two oars and no coxswain.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of helpful for the regular rowing stroke in our other boats because it helps with a balance aspect and putting everything together,” says Felix, a junior at Redwood High School. “And I think it actually helps apply to our other boats also, which is really great.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A Bay Area local shows East Coast friend the Golden State</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-bay-area-local-shows-east-coast-friend-the-golden-state</link>
     <description>It was the first time in Tiburon for both, one of several stops on Danser’s trip from New York City to visit Yang, who lives in San Jose.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Daltin Danser and Alex Yang grab coffees from Caffe Acri on Main Street Oct. 22 before boarding a morning ferry to visit Angel Island.</p>
<p>It was the first time in Tiburon for both, one of several stops on Danser’s trip from New York City to visit Yang, who lives in San Jose. The two had already explored San Francisco and were planning to visit Yosemite.</p>
<p>“I’m just kind of his driver,” Yang, 23, says of his role for Danser’s visit.</p>
<p>Danser, 22, meanwhile, has been acting as the official photographer for their trips, with Yang noting his friend’s particular fascination with plaques at sites and landmarks.</p>
<p>“He was scrolling through his camera, and he has like hundreds of them,” Yang says of Danser’s photos of plaques. “And I’m sure he’s never looked at them again.”</p>
<p>Danser is quick to challenge his friend’s assertion.</p>
<p>“I always look back at my plaques,” he says, adding that his favorite he captured so far was from their recent visit to Muir Woods National Monument.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon Town Hall exhibits feature multimedia collages, oil paintings</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-town-hall-exhibits-feature-multimedia-collages-oil-paintings</link>
     <description>Tiburon Heritage and Arts Commissioner Jaleh Etemad and Larkspur resident Debra Maddox are each exhibiting their works at Town Hall starting in November.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>‘Unseen’ is part of former Tiburon artist laureate Jaleh Etemad’s new Town Hall exhibit, opening Nov. 3, while 'Blue Polka Dot Dress’ is among the works on display at Debra Maddox’s Town Hall exhibit, ‘Evocations.’</p>
<p>Tiburon Heritage and Arts Commissioner Jaleh Etemad and Larkspur resident Debra Maddox are each exhibiting their works at Town Hall starting in November.</p>
<p>Etemad will show her multimedia collage works in a new exhibit opening Nov. 3 in the downstairs lobby. The exhibit coincides with the debut of her book, “Art of Life: Works by Jaleh Azar Etemad,” which includes nearly 300 of her pieces.</p>
<p>Etemad’s exhibit runs through Dec. 1 and features 35 paintings. An artist’s reception is set for 6-8 p.m. Nov. 7 at Town Hall and will include a conversation between Etemad and theater director, producer and educator Ginny Reed. Etemad will also sign copies of the book, which documents her evolution as an artist with numerous photos of her works. Each chapter describes moments that inspired her and the wide array of genres she has explored, including layered collage, painting, photography, altered books and three-dimensional works.</p>
<p>“As we live our lives, we evolve as human beings based on our various experiences,” she says. “I have done the same through my art.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Maddox’s exhibit, “Evocations,” will run Nov. 1-Dec. 31 in the upstairs Community Room and features two series of works in oil on canvas or oil on birch. An artist’s reception is set for 6-8 p.m. Nov. 11.</p>
<p>“I watch how light, shadow, color and texture transform shapes, and forms into compelling compositions,” she says. “This drives my desire to interpret what I see in the world around me. My work reflects two components — one is visual and the other is emotional.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Prescribed burn on Angel Island to begin as early as Oct. 31</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/prescribed-burn-on-angel-island-to-begin-as-early-as-oct-31</link>
     <description>The actual start date will depend on weather conditions, with the target Nov. 2.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Up to 100 acres of Angel Island State Park will undergo a prescribed burn beginning as early as Oct. 31.</p>
<p>California State Parks is leading the burn operation. Officials said in an Oct. 28 news release that residents should not call 911 to report smoke on the island.</p>
<p>State parks interpreter Ryan Forbes said in an email that while the prescribed burns may start as early as Halloween, the actual start date will depend on weather conditions. He said the burn will likely take place Nov. 2.</p>
<p>Smoke will likely be visible from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on burn days and may be visible for up to three days.</p>
<p>The operation aims to reduce fuel loads — combustible materials — in grasslands and coast-scrub areas on Angel Island.</p>
<p>The state park will remain open during burn days, and Angel Island-Tiburon Ferry service will not be affected, but trails and roads near the burn area will be closed for one to three days during and after the burn. Affected routes include segments of the Ida and Sunset trails and Park Fire Road. Access to Mount Livermore’s peak may also be limited on burn days.</p>
<p>Parks officials urged extreme caution for Angel Island visitors near the fire burns and asked them to follow posted signage and directions from parks staff or fire officials.</p>
<p>The burn is part of the parks agency’s Prescribed Fire Training Exchange, which gives firefighters and other fire personnel the opportunity to hone skills.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Reed district warned to rein in deficit spending</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-district-warned-to-rein-in-deficit-spending</link>
     <description>Unless the district cuts $1.75 million over two years, its reserves will fall short of the required 27% minimum by fiscal year 2027-2028.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Marin County Office of Education has warned the Reed Union School District about its “unsustainable” deficit spending, noting that unless the district cuts about $1.75 million from its budget in the next two years, it will fall short of its reserve goals by fiscal 2027-2028.</p>
<p>The warning was issued in a Sept. 15 letter approving the district’s current-year $33.2-million budget and its accompanying projections two years out; the county Office of Education is required to review the budget annually under the state education code to ensure it meets state standards for fiscal solvency and aligns with the district’s Local Control Accountability Plan.</p>
<p>Though the county has vouched for the district’s ability to meet its financial obligations in the next three years, the letter notes the district’s planned deficit spending will shrink its ending fund balance by 35% in that time as it pulls from its reserves to close the gap. That projection, it notes, is inclusive of a planned $300,000 in salary reductions beginning in the 2026-2027 school year.</p>
<p>If the district continues to deficit spend at the projected rates, the county letter says, its unrestricted general fund balance will fall to about 21.5% of expenditures, or about $7.6 million, by fiscal year 2027-2028 — short of the district policy that requires a minimum reserve of 27% of expenditures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Reed district test scores show gains in English, math</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-district-test-scores-show-gains-in-english-math</link>
     <description>Some 81% of Reed students met English standards and 79% met math standards, significantly outpacing Marin County and statewide averages.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Standardized test scores in the Reed Union School District rose about five percentage points in English and four points in math, with local students once again outperforming their peers across the county and state by significant margins.</p>
<p>Some 81% of Reed district students met or exceeded grade-level standards in English, 79% in math, according to results of the 2024-2025 exam released Oct. 9 by the California Department of Education. That’s up from the 76% of students who met or exceeded English standards and the 75% who met or exceeded math standards on last year’s exam.</p>
<p>The district’s scores remain markedly higher than the average in Marin, where about 62% of students met or exceeded standards in English and 54% in math. Statewide, just 49% of students met or exceeded standards in English, 37% in math.</p>
<p>Reed district Coordinator of Educational Services Nicole Trickett called the increases in both math and language arts “pretty significant,” noting that even when the district does see increases to scores, it doesn’t always see such a large bump.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>The 106-unit facility would include 71 independent-living apartments and 35 assisted-living suites on the 6.6-acre hillside site off North Knoll Road.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A five-story, 150,655-square-foot senior-care facility proposed for a vacant Strawberry hillside off North Knoll Road is advancing through Marin County’s approval process despite vocal opposition from neighbors who say the development doesn’t fit their semi-rural neighborhood.</p>
<p>The developers, brothers Ali Shabahangi and Amir Kia of San Anselmo-based Spirit Living Group, submitted the latest revision to their application Oct. 6, proposing 106 total units, with 71 independent-living apartments and 35 assisted-living and memory-care suites. The building would occupy 3.7 acres of the 6.6-acre site at 70 N. Knoll Road, with the remaining acreage to be preserved as open space.</p>
<p>The county now has until Nov. 6 to deem the application complete or incomplete under the ministerial-review process, or streamlined approval in which local governments must approve projects that meet objective standards without discretionary hearings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The officer, employed by the Tiburon Police Department since June 2019, was off duty when arrested about 4 p.m. and then booked into Sonoma County Jail in Santa Rosa on allegations of child abuse with possible great bodily injury or death — a “wobbler” case that could result in a misdemeanor or felony charge punishable by up to six years in prison and a $10,000 fine if convicted — plus two misdemeanor allegations of drunken driving.</p>
<p>One is for suspicion of impaired driving at any level of intoxication and the other for exceeding a blood-alcohol content of at least 0.08%, California’s legal limit for drivers 21 and older. Drivers convicted of a first-time DUI face an average of $13,500 in fines and penalties as well as a suspended license, according to Tiburon police.</p>
<p>The Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office confirmed it is reviewing the case for the potential charges.</p>
<p>“The Tiburon Police Department will fully cooperate with the ongoing investigation led by the Sonoma County (District Attorney’s) Office,” Chief Michelle Jean said in an Oct. 20 press statement. “In addition, the town is reviewing the circumstances of the arrest and has engaged with an independent investigator to ensure a fair and impartial review of whether any Police Department policies were violated. The Police Department holds its officers to the highest standards of conduct and, pending the results of both the criminal investigation and administrative review, will take appropriate action that reflects the values of the department.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere council reduces Blanding Lane construction fine to $210,000</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-council-reduces-blanding-lane-construction-fine-to-210-000</link>
     <description>The penalty was reduced by $120,000 after the council granted relief for fire training use and water district delays but rejected other claims.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Blanding Lane homeowner will pay a $210,000 penalty for construction delays after the Belvedere City Council granted only partial relief from his original $330,000 fine.</p>
<p>Owner Chris Henry had appealed for a complete waiver of the penalty. At the Oct. 13 City Council meeting, officials agreed to reduce the fine by $120,000 after a two-hour hearing but denied most of his arguments for leniency.</p>
<p>The city’s construction time-limit ordinance allows 18 months to finish a project costing over $500,000, with an optional six-month extension. Henry’s deadline expired April 21, 2024. Penalties accrued daily at $1,200 through the project’s completion April 8, 2025 — 320 days late.</p>
<p>The council voted unanimously to grant 100 days of relief. The reduction covered 10 days Henry allowed Tiburon Fire Protection District to use the property for training exercises and 90 days for delays caused by a Marin Municipal Water District infrastructure leak.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon council OKs commission’s picks for early design of ponds site, mini parks</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-council-oks-commission-s-picks-for-early-design-of-ponds-site-mini-parks</link>
     <description>Two design firms will create conceptual plans for a basketball court, new swings and improvements at the former sanitation ponds site by spring 2026.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will spend $94,600 to create early design concepts for improvements at the former sanitation ponds site and three neighborhood mini parks, including a basketball court and new swings.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously Oct. 15 to approve contracts with two firms for 30% conceptual designs. Mill Valley-based RHAA Landscape Architecture and Planning will design improvements at Belveron Mini Park and the former ponds site near McKegney Green for $49,728. Santa Rosa-based Carlile Macy Inc. will design improvements at Cypress Hollow Park and the Bel Aire play area for $44,870.</p>
<p>The agreements allow the council to review conceptual plans before deciding whether to proceed with full construction documents, Public Works Engineering Manager David Eshoo wrote in a staff report. Funding comes from the town’s fiscal year 2025-2026 capital improvement program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere runner sets world record in 800-meter race at Santa Barbara meet</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-runner-sets-world-record-in-800-meter-race-at-santa-barbara-meet</link>
     <description>Nancy Simmons clocked 2:38.05 at the Santa Barbara meet, beating the previous 2:39.61 record set in 2016 by 1.56 seconds.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere resident Nancy Simmons set a world record in the women’s 65-69 age group 800-meter run Oct. 19 at the Beverley Lewis Memorial Open/Masters Track and Field meet at Westmont College in Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>Simmons clocked 2:38.05, besting the previous world record of 2:39.61 set in 2016 by 1.56 seconds.</p>
<p>The achievement came just five months after Simmons ran her first 800 as part of a relay team that set a world record May 24 in Fairfax, Virginia.</p>
<p>Simmons won the 800-meter race at the USATF Masters Outdoor Championships in Huntsville, Alabama, in July with a time of 2:41.77. After that race, she said she realized she was about 2 seconds off the world record and set a goal to break it.</p>
<p>“I’m going to take some time to rest my body and my brain and then think about what’s next,” she said.</p>
<p>Simmons competes with Impala Racing Team and has been running competitively since 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Three retired 65-year-olds log 13,000 steps during regular walks while catching up on life after decades in different careers.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joan Boyce, Gay Maxey and Patty LaVine have turned Blackie’s Pasture into their regular meeting spot since retiring. The three 65-year-olds walk the path, logging about 13,000 steps while talking about their lives after decades in different careers.</p>
<p>The path sits partway between where each of them lives — Boyce and LaVine in Santa Rosa, Maxey in San Francisco. On Oct. 15, they met for one of their regular walks.</p>
<p>“It’s calm and peaceful and beautiful and safe,” LaVine says. “We love it here.”</p>
<p>LaVine recalls bringing her kids to Tiburon years ago for travel soccer matches and marveling that the field sat right on the water.</p>
<p>“We used to play on that field, and I’m like, ‘How crazy is this?’” she says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Susan Ann Compton Carpenter</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/susan-ann-compton-carpenter</link>
     <description>Susan Ann Compton Carpenter of Tiburon died September 17, 2025.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Susan Ann Compton Carpenter had a peaceful and easy life — full of love, joy and science. She was born in Metropolis, Illinois, on December 23, 1941, to Wava Jennette Lambert and Robert Wilson Compton. Her house in those early years did not have indoor plumbing. Her parents moved early in her life to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, seeking work which proved a turning point for the family. Oak Ridge was a town built to support research and engineering in physics. With that exposure, her family’s expectations dramatically changed.</p>
<p>She went to college and studied physics. During college, she met the man who would become her husband, Joe Carpenter. He was also studying hard sciences. After marriage, she primarily worked to support her husband’s career. Joe went on to get his PhD in Metallurgical Engineering and rise to become a manager in the scientific field. They were married for 60 years.</p>
<p>She lived most of her life in Oak Ridge, TN, and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>She raised two children, Keri and Tim, in Tennessee. Both followed the success of their parents and pursued advanced degrees in computer science and law, respectively.</p>
<p>In 1998, they moved to the Gangplank Marina in Washington, D.C. Joe worked nearby as a scientist until 2010. She started and was the first commodore of the Gangplank Slipholders Association (GPSA) yacht club and has been instrumental in the club both from a social and political advocacy standpoint for over 20 years.</p>
<p>Throughout their entire lives, Susan and Joe also got huge amounts of enjoyment from traveling. The 1970s saw them take yearly car trips across the U.S. with their two young children. In the ’80s, they took a seminal trip to India to visit the family of a colleague of Joe’s from graduate school, Naginder Naidu. The ’90s saw more adventurous travel into Ukraine and multiple trips to Europe as their children studied abroad. They also traveled to China, The Philippines, Japan, Egypt, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and South and Central America.</p>
<p>In 2010, when a marina friend asked if she wanted to go on safari, she answered “Heck yes!” and ventured forth into South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. Many more trips abounded until about 2020, when Susan’s health woes started to keep them mostly stateside. She moved to Tiburon in 2024 to be cared for by her daughter and son-in-law. Her earthly journeys came to a peaceful conclusion on September 17, 2025. She was surrounded with love, family and friends until ...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Garden Plot: Artificial lawns are a tidy solution with some hidden costs</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/garden-plot-artificial-lawns-are-a-tidy-solution-with-some-hidden-costs</link>
     <description>Homeowners praise the tidiness and low maintenance but must weigh environmental concerns, PFAS chemicals, heat retention, and high installation costs.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you thought about replacing your water- and maintenance-nightmare of a lawn with artificial turf? I talked to a few homeowners who have installed synthetic lawns, and people seem very happy with the product and tidiness of their gardens after these installations. A friend told me that it makes her happy just to look out at her backyard “lawn.” Gone are the maintenance, toxic weed killers and huge water bills, along with the two big G’s — grubs and gophers — not to mention moles, which are some of the most vexing pests that can try the patience of those who love their lawns.</p>
<p>The decision to remove a lawn and install artificial turf opens a whole new can of worms. First, you’ll want to do some research about what the turf is made from, as that can range from old tires to plastic bottles. There’s some evidence that these products, made from ground-up plastics, can create runoff that’s not environmentally friendly. Then there’s the dreaded PFAS moniker for the thousands of substances of “forever chemicals” that persist almost indefinitely. Artificial turf can also be hot in warm weather, and upfront installation is costly.</p>]]></content:encoded>
