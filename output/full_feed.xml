     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon residents have until 5 p.m. Feb. 13 to apply for 15 volunteer positions on nine town and county boards and commissions, with terms for most seats expiring at the end of February.</p>
<p>The openings span the Planning Commission; the Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission; the Heritage and Arts Commission; the Diversity Inclusion Task Force; the Belvedere-Tiburon Library Agency; the Belvedere-Tiburon Joint Disaster Advisory Council; the Building Code Appeals Board; the Marin-Sonoma Mosquito and Vector Control District Board; and the Marin Commission on Aging.</p>
<p>All seats are unpaid, volunteer positions, and applicants must be Tiburon residents, except for the Diversity Inclusion Task Force, which is open to Belvedere residents; the Disaster Advisory Council, which is open only to residents of unincorporated Tiburon; and the Building Code Appeals Board, which includes those who work in town, though candidates must have a working knowledge of the town’s building code.</p>
<p>Planning Commission, two four-year seats:The terms of Eric Woodward and Kathleen Defever expire Feb. 28. Woodward, a member since 2019, and Defever, who was first appointed in 2018, both said they plan to reapply. The five-member board is the town’s planning agency and meets on second and fourth Wednesdays to review items such as the general plan, conditional use permits, zoning and zoning text amendments.</p>
<p>Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission, two four-year seats:The terms of Michael Moon and Liz Judge expire Feb. 28.</p>
<p>Judge, who was appointed in 2022, said she was not reapplying because of increased professional commitments that have made it “really challenging to give (the commission) all the time I feel it deserves.” Moon, who was appointed in 2023 and is currently commission chair, did not respond by press deadline to an inquiry about whether he planned to reapply. The five-member commission meets on third Tuesdays every other month and makes recommendations to the Planning Commission and Town Council on policy matters pertaining to parks and open space under the town’s jurisdiction. It also serves as the town’s Bicycle-Pedestrian Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Heritage and Arts Commission, two four-year seats:The terms of Jaleh Etemad, who’s served since 2018, and Azita de Mujica, a commissioner since 2010, expire Feb. 28, and both said they will reapply. The seven-person commission meets on fourth Tuesdays with a mission to promote arts programs on the T...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Every two years, the scholars with Strawberry-based SHE-CAN reunite in the Bay Area for a weeklong leadership summit.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three college-age women from Guatemala and Cambodia are sitting shoulder to shoulder on a Shoreline Park bench the morning of Jan. 7. They lean into one another as they discuss education, opportunity and the long paths that brought them from the rural farmland of their home countries to where they now sit: viewing the San Francisco skyline across the bay.</p>
<p>They’ve come to the Tiburon Peninsula as scholars with SHE-CAN — Supporting Her Education Changes A Nation — a Strawberry-based organization that helps young women from Cambodia, Liberia, Rwanda and Guatemala win full-ride scholarships to universities across the U.S. Every two years, the scholars, now spread across campuses nationwide, reunite in the Bay Area for a weeklong leadership summit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Natalia Settembrini Casillas passed away on November 13, 2025, at the age of 83.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Natalia Settembrini Casillas passed away on November 13, 2025, at the age of 83, after a courageous battle with heart disease. She died peacefully, at home in Tiburon, surrounded by loved ones. She was the love of my life and my best friend.</p>
<p>Natalia was born in Puglia, a peninsula in Southern Italy surrounded by turquoise waters and white sandy beaches. Natalia loved to cook and entertain her family and friends. She often hosted large lunch and dinner parties at “Villa Natalia,” her beautiful hilltop home in Tiburon, with its panoramic views of the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, and the Bay, as well as the home’s terraces, tiles, and gardens that reminded her of the Amalfi Coast, one of her favorite parts of Italy.</p>
<p>Natalia is survived by her husband of 41 years, Mark Casillas of Tiburon, her two sons, five grandchildren, a great-grandson, and two sisters. A detailed obituary was published on her Facebook pagewww.facebook.com/natalia.settembrinicasillasand in the San Francisco Chronicle atwww.legacy.comorwww.bit.ly/NataliaCasillas.</p>
<p>Natalia’s funeral was at Queen of Heaven Cemetery, Lafayette, CA, where her remains reside. She would be delighted by your visit; she would greet you warmly with her beautiful smiling photo and memorial. In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to the American Heart Association.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Nature serves as inspiration for abstract works in Belvedere-Tiburon Library exhibit</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/nature-serves-as-inspiration-for-abstract-works-in-belvedere-tiburon-library-exhibit</link>
     <description>&quot;Abstracting Nature” at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library runs Jan. 15-March 11.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The inspiration for Jennifer Francis Fearon’s painting “Natural Optimism 2” came from a photo of light rippling on water.</p>
<p>The Belvedere artist made an engraved print from the photo, using a non-toxic process that included soy-based inks and Japanese paper. This print was then mounted on a wood panel and overpainted with mineral pigments.</p>
<p>For Fearon, 64, painting is a way to “stay present, to notice small movements and moments that might otherwise be missed.”</p>
<p>“My work is really about paying attention to place, to materials and to the subtle forces that connect us to the natural world we live in every day,” she says.</p>
<p>Fearon’s “Natural Optimism 2” is one of 59 works on display from as many Bay Area artists in “Abstracting Nature” at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library. The exhibit, which runs Jan. 15-March 11, showcases paintings, drawings and photographs inspired by nature and reinterpreted as abstractions.</p>
<p>An artists’ reception is set for 6-8 p.m. Jan. 15, and a free ARTtalk with environmental artist David Maisel sharing his abstract paintings and photographs is set for 6:30-7:30 p.m. Feb. 19.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Strawberry resident helps transform homes for those coming out of crisis</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-resident-helps-transform-homes-for-those-coming-out-of-crisis</link>
     <description>Hilary Sessions is a volunteer and board member for Make It Home, which helps furnish homes for those transitioning from being unhoused.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those transitioning out of crisis, obtaining housing can provide much needed stability — but it takes a lot more than a roof over their heads to make a house feel like a home.</p>
<p>“One of the problems, if you have a family or someone that’s really on the edge, if they move into a vacant home and they don’t have any money to spend on furniture or even a bed or a desk or pots and pans, there’s a good chance that they will slip back into the system because they don’t really have a home, they have a place to sleep,” says Strawberry resident Hilary Sessions.</p>
<p>That’s where Make It Home steps in — and where Sessions, 59, has found her calling as both a volunteer and a member of the organization’s board of directors. The Marin-based nonprofit furnishes homes for people in the social-welfare system, building a bridge between federally subsidized Section 8 housing and possessing a true home, an often-overlooked element in preventing recidivism.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon man advocates for youth, the unhoused in volunteer roles</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-man-advocates-for-youth-the-unhoused-in-volunteer-roles</link>
     <description>Longtime Tiburon resident Jim Snipes has been volunteering as a court-appointed special advocate with Marin CASA for about eight years.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jim Snipes first learned about court-appointed special advocates, volunteers who work to support youth in the foster-care system, during a lunchtime presentation at his San Francisco law firm.</p>
<p>He recalls being struck by some of the statistics shared about the risks facing foster youth, including a higher likelihood of ending up unhoused. Court-appointed special advocates, or CASAs, work to change those outcomes by speaking up for the best interests of youth in the courtroom and as the kids move through the child-welfare system.</p>
<p>At the time, Snipes was winding down his three-decade legal career and was looking for ways to get more involved in the community as he entered retirement.</p>
<p>“I thought, ‘This sounds like a great prospect,’“ he recalls.</p>
<p>Snipes, 72, is now in his eighth year volunteering as a court-appointed special advocate with Marin CASA. In his role, the Tiburon resident is assigned to one or two youth in the foster-care or juvenile-justice systems at a time and works to establish a relationship with them, advocating for their fundamental medical, educational and mental-health needs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Young advocates push for mental health and racial equity</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/young-advocates-push-for-mental-health-and-racial-equity</link>
     <description>Madeleine Gillespie&apos;s and Vera Woo&apos;s desires to create change led them to join the Marin County Youth Commission.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local teens Madeleine Gillespie and Vera Woo will spend the next year on the Marin County Youth Commission, which is focusing its work on five topics: mental health, racial equity, disability justice, immigrant justice and alcohol and drug prevention. (Amelia Plumb / For The Ark)</p>
<p>Local teens Madeleine Gillespie and Vera Woo were each looking for a way to get more involved in community issues as they moved through high school.</p>
<p>Madeleine says she’s long been interested in women’s rights and educational rights. She’s participated in some local protests, which she says sparked a desire to continue to speak out against injustice.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to do as much as I could to help the people who, often, their voices are stifled and they don’t have the opportunity to stand up for themselves at times because of the way our society works,” says the Belvedere resident, a junior at Tamalpais High School.</p>
<p>Vera, meanwhile, says growing up Asian American in predominantly white Marin County could be isolating at times and shaped her interest in racial justice, adding that as a person of color, she’s often felt “out of place” among her peers.</p>
<p>“I really just want to get involved and make other people who may be experiencing that to not have to go through the same experience I went through,” says Vera, who attended Reed Union School District schools and is now a sophomore at The Branson School.</p>
<p>Both girls’ desires to create change led them to join the Marin County Youth Commission. They were each appointed to the board in August and will spend the next year working alongside nearly two dozen other teens to learn more about and help tackle some of the county’s most pressing issues, from mental health and racial equity to disability justice, immigrant justice and alcohol and drug prevention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>For his longstanding dedication to the organization, Dave Gotz has been named the Landmarks Society’s 2025 Volunteer of the Year.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dave Gotz has spent nearly 30 years working and volunteering with the Belvedere-Tiburon Landmarks Society, and in that time he has gained a reputation as a bit of a renaissance man. He has an extensive knowledge of local history — he spent more than a decade as the society’s archivist — but he has also been tapped for his knowledge of computers and has helped troubleshoot electricity and plumbing issues.</p>
<p>For his longstanding dedication to the organization, Gotz has been named the Landmarks Society’s 2025 Volunteer of the Year.</p>
<p>“Dave has been an incredible part of Landmarks for so many years,” says Executive Director Patty Flax. “He’s done it all and now is our go-to volunteer for just about everything. His creativity and commitment make him an invaluable part of the Landmarks family.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Volunteer’s vision helps transform library gallery into regional arts hub</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/volunteer-s-vision-helps-transform-library-gallery-into-regional-arts-hub</link>
     <description>Diane Green helped user the shift from solo shows of local artists to a juried exhibition venue that draws artists from across the Bay Area.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diane Green had been organizing art exhibits at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library for about a decade by 2019, when construction began on the library’s $18.31 million expansion. The timing seemed right, she says, to step aside from her volunteer role on the art committee and hand off the responsibility.</p>
<p>Then she took a hard-hat tour of the construction site and saw what would become a dedicated gallery space boasting some 65 linear wall feet, with another 35 feet available for display in the hallways.</p>
<p>“I turned the corner and I saw that gallery, and my heart just started thumping,” says Green, 72. “I went, ‘Whoa, I’m not ready to go yet.’”</p>
<p>The Tiburon resident immediately saw the potential to transform the library’s exhibition program.</p>
<p>“Let’s see what kind of quality artists are willing to bring their art over here, and let’s see what kind of conversation comes out of that,” she recalls thinking.</p>
<p>Since the gallery opened as part of the remodeled library in 2022, Green has helped transform the library from hosting solo shows focused on local artists to a highly regarded exhibition venue that draws artists from across the Bay Area for juried shows exploring diverse themes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Longtime Tiburon resident Bill Brinkman, 79, has been a volunteer with Tiburon Peninsula Village for about seven years.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Teri Kuhns says she looks forward to seeing Bill Brinkman every time he fulfills one of her requests through Tiburon Peninsula Village, a group dedicated to helping local residents remain in their homes as they age.</p>
<p>As a volunteer for the group, Brinkman has driven Kuhns, 90, to appointments and helped out with other small tasks around her Belvedere home, including resetting her electric stove when it wouldn’t stop beeping.</p>
<p>But what Kuhns says she enjoys about the visits is not just the help she receives but the camaraderie. She and Brinkman chat, laugh and listen to music, she says, and he feels like a friend.</p>
<p>“We just get to know each other, and it’s in the most wonderful way,” Kuhns says. “These are the kind of people you want for friends, people who donate their time, so you’re in wonderful company.”</p>
<p>Longtime Tiburon resident Brinkman, 79, has been a volunteer with Tiburon Peninsula Village for about seven years now. He typically spends a few hours a week driving area seniors to medical appointments or to run errands. He’ll change light bulbs, make minor plumbing adjustments, assemble furniture and help with other tasks that enable aging residents to feel safe, comfortable and confident at home.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>That early training sparked a lifetime affinity for theater and film. For the past 35 years, Tomber has volunteered for community theater organizations and film societies in the Bay Area and Hawaii, serving on production teams and boards.</p>
<p>In November, Tomber was recognized by the Mountain Play with its Tamalpais Award, honoring her eight-year tenure as a board member, which wrapped up in 2025.

     <description>Visitors can see what the peninsula looked like 150 years ago, from Main Street stores to plans to build a utopian community.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Visitors to Town Hall can step back in time to see what the Tiburon Peninsula looked like 150 years ago, including what stores lined Tiburon’s Main Street and failed plans to build Hygeia, a utopian residential community in town.</p>
<p>Those details and more of life on the peninsula in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are captured in a series of original and reproduced historical maps of Tiburon, Belvedere and the surrounding area on display through Jan. 28 in Town Hall’s downstairs gallery. A reception is scheduled for 6-8 p.m. Jan. 22.</p>
<p>The exhibit, “Historic Maps from the Landmarks Society Archives,” is curated by Belvedere-Tiburon Landmarks Society Archivist Jennifer Hartung and Town Historian Dave Gotz and features 15 maps from the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Flooding, outages test Tiburon Peninsula&apos;s preparedness</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/worst-flooding-in-decades-submerges-highway-101-tiburon-peninsula-roads-knocks-out-911</link>
     <description>A four-day deluge of king tides and storms Jan. 1-4 brought the worst coastal flooding to Marin County in nearly three decades.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pickup truck was abandoned on the Redwood Highway frontage road at De Silva Island Drive in Strawberry while inbound Tiburon Boulevard was fully submerged about 11 a.m. Jan. 3, shortly after the peak king tide, which also flooded both directions of Highway 101 at Lucky Drive in Corte Madera. (Kevin Hessel / The Ark; Amy Rennert)</p>
<p>A four-day deluge of king tides and atmospheric-river storms Jan. 1-4 brought the worst coastal flooding to Marin County in nearly three decades, submerging Highway 101 and local roads while temporarily knocking out 911 service countywide.</p>
<p>Tides climbed 2½ feet above normal at the San Francisco gauge Jan. 3, the fourth highest on record and matching levels unseen since Feb. 6, 1998, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
<p>Highway 101 at Lucky Drive in Corte Madera was submerged at the peak, as was the Redwood Highway frontage road at De Silva Island Drive in Strawberry, Tiburon Boulevard’s inbound lanes near the 76 gas station and adjacent Greenwood Cove Drive, as well as downtown Beach Road. Belvedere Mayor Sally Wilkinson told the Marin Independent Journal that Beach Road along the cove faced bay waters that rose to within inches of overtopping, while Tiburon Councilmember Holli Thier said flooded equipment caused business power outages along Main Street. Some 1,500 homes reportedly lost electricity across Tiburon and Marin City.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, floodwaters submerged an AT&T communications hub in San Rafael about 8:30 p.m. Jan. 4, crippling emergency dispatch and forcing officials to urge residents in need of aid to go directly to fire stations, according to media reports. Service was restored by 1 a.m. 5.</p>
<p>The weather pattern shifts this week, with rain tapering off through Jan. 7 and high pressure arriving Jan. 8, according to National Weather Service forecasts. Dry conditions are expected through at least Jan. 13.</p>

     <title>Strawberry neighbors still see red flags in seminary-site plan</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-neighbors-still-see-red-flags-in-seminary-site-plan</link>
     <description>Neighbors say the final EIR proves the project is too large — with one attorney threatening legal action if changes aren’t made.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three environmental impacts from the proposed 336-unit redevelopment of the former Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary in Strawberry cannot be avoided, according to a final county review that neighbors say proves the project is too large — with one attorney calling it “an entire new city on a hill” and threatening legal action if changes aren’t made.</p>
<p>The 684-page environmental report, released by Marin County Dec. 12, identifies traffic, greenhouse-gas emissions and construction noise as significant impacts that cannot be fully mitigated. The document also cites nine additional significant impacts that county officials say can be reduced to less-than-significant levels if all proposed measures work as planned.</p>
<p>The county has opened a 45-day public comment period that ends at 4 p.m. Jan. 26.</p>
<p>Seminary Neighborhood Association attorney Riley Hurd said the identified impacts — 13 in total — should give county supervisors pause.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, that’s 13 significant environmental impacts from this project,” Hurd said. “Environmental review is supposed to inform decision-makers about the environmental impacts of projects … so that they can make an educated vote. Here, the information is out. And it is telling the Board of Supervisors that if you were to proceed with this project as currently designed, it will be extremely impactful.”</p>
<p>The 127-acre project at 201 Seminary Drive would transform the site into a mixed-use development with 336 single- and multifamily residential units — including 70 affordable units — and a 150-unit senior residential-care facility. The project also includes a 17,000-square-foot fitness center and a 3,000-square-foot preschool, both open to the public. While more than 70% of the campus would remain as open space, athletic fields, paths and plazas, the project would add about 530 new residents and about 250 new workers at full build-out.</p>
<p>Developer North Coast Land Holdings LLC also proposes maintaining an academic campus for up to 1,000 students under an existing 1953 conditional use permit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Reed board wants more public input on $115M school bond</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-board-wants-more-public-input-on-115m-school-bond</link>
     <description>Survey results show approval is “viable” but far from a sure thing.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An early survey of Reed Union School District voters revealed tentative support for a $115-million facilities bond measure, but board members want more community feedback before they decide whether to place the initiative on the November ballot.</p>
<p>A poll of 223 district voters likely to vote in the Nov. 3, 2026, election found 62% would support the proposed bond without any additional information about the tax measure or the district. That number rose to about 65% after voters were given educational statements about the bond measure but declined to about 59% after an exchange of educational statements and negative messaging, according to Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz & Associates, or FM3, the research firm hired to conduct the survey.</p>
<p>The poll had a 6.6% margin of error. The bond measure would need 55% voter approval to pass.</p>
<p>The results show approval is “viable” but far from a sure thing, Richard Bernard, a partner at FM3, told board members at their Dec. 15 meeting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere agrees to pay $50k to settle lawsuit over construction time penalty</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-agrees-to-pay-50k-to-settle-lawsuit-over-construction-time-penalty</link>
     <description>The $254,400 penalty remains final while the $50,000 represents new settlement consideration rather than a refund or reimbursement.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere is paying $50,000 to settle a federal lawsuit challenging a Eucalyptus Road homeowner’s construction time-limit penalty, ending a legal battle that cost the city another $82,500 in attorney fees to litigate.</p>
<p>Laurent and Marguerite Lefouet filed suit in U.S. District Court in April after the City Council upheld a $254,400 penalty for a renovation that ran 257 days past its deadline. The couple paid the fine in February but argued it violated constitutional protections against excessive fines and denial of due process.</p>
<p>They reached a no-fault settlement in November that dismisses the lawsuit with prejudice and includes mutual releases, City Manager Robert Zadnik said. Court records show the case was dismissed Dec. 3, and Zadnik said details were being finalized last week.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the penalty amount remains final while the $50,000 represents new settlement consideration rather than a refund or reimbursement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Point Tiburon Plaza coffee cart gets initial approval from town</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/point-tiburon-plaza-coffee-cart-gets-initial-approval-from-town</link>
     <description>The owners must provide more details on wastewater disposal, visual screening and operations before receiving formal approval.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A coffee cart proposed for Point Tiburon Plaza won preliminary support from planning officials Dec. 9, but owners must provide more details on wastewater disposal, visual screening and operations before receiving formal approval.</p>
<p>The Tiburon Planning Commission voted 4-0, with Commissioner Jeff Tsai absent, to continue the item while directing staff to prepare a resolution approving the conditional use permit. Commissioners told town staff to work with Paradise Coffee owners Samuel Cook and Juan Carlos Caamal to address how the business will discard wastewater, cover the trailer’s hitch and wheels during operations and manage sidewalk access for deliveries.</p>
<p>The 18-foot-by-10-foot trailer is already sitting on the grass between the Marin Transit bus stop and the plaza’s flower-shop gazebo at 1775 Tiburon Blvd. It would operate 6 a.m.-4 p.m. daily with no more than three workers, offering premade pastries, sandwiches and coffee drinks. The trailer would draw electricity from the nearby gazebo.</p>]]></content:encoded>
