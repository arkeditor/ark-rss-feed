     <title>Ex-mayor pitches pedestrian tunnel to trail near Del Mar</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/ex-mayor-pitches-pedestrian-tunnel-to-trail-near-del-mar</link>
     <description>&quot;Light bulb moment&quot; envisions 22-foot connection between neighborhoods and Old Rail Trail, but councilmembers want traffic reduction first.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former Tiburon mayor is pitching a new idea he says could reduce traffic congestion and increase safety along Tiburon Boulevard: a pedestrian and bike tunnel that would run underneath the road and connect the Old Rail Trail to the Del Mar Middle School tennis courts, where it would then meet an existing pedestrian path that leads to the Reed Heights-Tiburon Knolls and Del Mar neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Andrew Thompson said he has spent about seven months talking about the idea with neighbors, town staff and Reed Union School District officials, as well as a tunnel-construction company headed by a Tiburon resident, though he declined to name the company.</p>
<p>For now, the idea is just that — a suggestion, both Thompson and Town Manager Greg Chanis said, with Chanis noting the town is treating the idea like all resident-submitted traffic ideas, including forwarding it to Parametrix, a consultant working on a traffic study of Tiburon Boulevard, Paradise Drive and Trestle Glen Boulevard. A draft of the study is expected to be presented to the Town Council in November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Dead coyote in Belvedere likely pup of mated pair, expert says</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/dead-coyote-in-belvedere-likely-pup-of-mated-pair-expert-says</link>
     <description>Second coyote death in a year raises questions about poisoning, while experts say lethal control methods don&apos;t work anyway.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A coyote found dead in a Golden Gate Avenue driveway Aug. 22 was likely a 5-month-old pup of Belvedere’s resident mated pair, according to the city’s wildlife expert.</p>
<p>Despite initial concerns the pup may have been poisoned or killed on purpose, consultant Rebecca Dmytryk ofHumane Wildlife Controlsaid there were no obvious signs of poisoning, though a toxicology test is pending.</p>
<p>A resident reported the coyote to the Belvedere Police Department after spotting the animal about 6 feet down from the top of their driveway. Marin Humane was called to document the incident and remove the animal carcass.</p>
<p>It was the second such coyote death reported in less than a year, as a male coyote carcass was discovered by a resident on Belvedere Way in October. In that case, California Department of Fish and Wildlife toxicology tests determined the animal had likely died after ingesting antifreeze, while it also tested positive for six rodenticides, five of which were anticoagulant compounds that caused mild but nonlethal hemorrhaging.</p>
<p>It was unclear if the coyote had been exposed to the substances accidentally or intentionally amid an ongoing debate among residents about how to best deal with coyotes on the peninsula.</p>
<p>Animals can ingest anticoagulant rodenticides either by directly consuming bait, by eating rodents that have ingested the poison or by eating those rodents’ predators.</p>
<p>Local coyote family is two adults, four to five pups</p>
<p>Dmytryk said she could not comment definitively on the cause of death for the pup found Aug. 22, but she noted photographs showed that the animal’s body was not exhibiting some of the telltale signs of poisoning, including straight, stiff legs.</p>
<p>She said the results of the toxicology tests will likely take several weeks.</p>
<p>The pup was one of a litter born about five months ago to the resident male and female pair, Dmytryk said. She said she’s unsure about the exact number of pups but that Marin Humane believes it to be four or five.</p>
<p>The male adult coyote that died in October had been the mate of the resident female. Those two animals had a litter of five pups that remained on the peninsula while young but have since dispersed to other areas, Dmytryk said. The female then took on a new partner, and their current litter will follow the same pattern, she said. They’ll explore the peninsula and most will likely disperse to wider areas in the coming months, with the exception of o...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Ex-official sues Tiburon over alleged pregnancy harassment</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/ex-official-sues-tiburon-over-alleged-pregnancy-harassment</link>
     <description>Fired town official claims colleagues mocked &quot;pregnant belly and pregnant ass&quot; while manager refused to intervene.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon’s former director of administrative services is suing the town, alleging she was harassed by two of her colleagues throughout her pregnancy and upon her return from maternity leave. She also alleges top officials, including the town manager, not only failed to stop the behavior but retaliated against her when she reported it.</p>
<p>In the complaint, which was filed in Sonoma Superior Court and is currently being transferred to Marin Superior Court, Suzanne Creekmore accuses Finance Manager Troy Bassett and former Director of Community Development Dina Tasini of making disparaging remarks about her pregnancy, which she disclosed in summer 2022.</p>
<p>Bassett, who reported directly to Creekmore, allegedly called a pregnant woman’s stomach a “horrible belly” and said she was “‘pissed’ about (Creekmore’s) planned maternity leave because her temporary absence would impact (Bassett’s) ‘lifestyle,’” while Tasini reportedly mocked Creekmore’s appearance, including saying she had a “pregnant belly, and a pregnant ass!” in front of colleagues and telling Creekmore in private to “get a different job” because Creekmore “would no longer be able to perform her duties as director once her baby was born.”</p>
<p>Creekmore's claim states she was fired in April 2024. All those named in the suit declined to comment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere’s first lot-split property hits the market</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-s-first-lot-split-property-hits-the-market</link>
     <description>The city is counting on the 2022 law to help meet its 2031 housing mandate.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first new Belvedere home created under California’s lot-splitting law has hit the market.</p>
<p>Resident Christina Wang of 421 Golden Gate Ave. successfully broke off about 40% of her 22,783-square-foot parcel under 2022’s Senate Bill 9. She listed the new address, 419 Golden Gate Ave., for $4.25 million in April. The new 9,113-square-foot lot — on the southern ridge of Belvedere Island with views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Richardson Bay and Sausalito to the east and Belvedere Cove and Tiburon to the west — contains a two-bedroom, 925-square-foot residence that previously served as the larger property’s guest house.</p>
<p>It also creates one new market-rate unit in Belvedere’s housing inventory.</p>
<p>The city must add 160 new units in the state’s 2023-2031 housing cycle, and lot splits play a key role in Belvedere’s planning roadmap, projecting 27 of those units will be created under the new law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Trip hazards prompt Belvedere to flatten six mounds at playground</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/trip-hazards-prompt-belvedere-to-flatten-six-mounds-at-playground</link>
     <description>Parks officials will study liability issues and removal of the other six.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere will remove six rubber mounds from Community Park’s playground after city officials determined they pose tripping hazards to children and families using the facility.</p>
<p>The city plans to flatten the tan-colored mounds at the edge of the playground’s tanbark area and blend them into the surrounding rubberized surface. Associate Engineer Chris Barry told the Parks, Open Spaces and Lanes Committee Aug. 21 that these mounds present “more of a tripping hazard” because their coloring blends with the tanbark, making them hard to see.</p>
<p>Barry said the city expects the removal project to cost $7,000 to $10,000, with work expected to begin in mid to late September.</p>
<p>However, there are six more blue-colored mounds, and committee members said they want all 12 removed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon panel wants another look at sites for public-art ‘street signs’</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-panel-wants-another-look-at-sites-for-public-art-street-signs</link>
     <description>Tiburon Heritage and Arts Commission delays decision on $20K positive-message street sign project until September.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon officials want the artist behind a proposed public-art project to reconsider where his positive-message street signs would go before they decide whether to recommend the temporary installation.</p>
<p>The Heritage and Arts Commission voted 6-0 Aug. 26, with Commissioner Jaleh Etemad absent, to keep working with artist Scott Froschauer to refine his “The Word on the Street” proposal, aiming to review it again Sept. 23.</p>
<p>Froschauer creates vandalism-resistant signs built to U.S. Transportation Department standards but replaces the typical commands with affirmations.</p>
<p>After discussing Froschauer’s proposal at its June and July meetings, the arts board asked the artist to come back with more specific details about the signs. The most recent plans from Froschauer, who visited Tiburon Aug. 20 and met with commission Chair Arjun Gupta, call for 15 signs, which would cost a total of $20,000: $1,000 per sign and a $5,000 start-up fee. He reduced the exhibition period from one year to six months, proposing signs at Zelinsky Park, Cypress Hollow Park, Teather Park and South of the Knoll Park.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere’s Land Co. Park may soon have a new three-tiered drinking fountain donated by longtime residents as a “legacy gift” to the community.</p>
<p>The Planning Commission is set to vote Sept. 16 on installing the stone fountain at the pocket park on Beach Road between the Belvedere Land Co. offices and the San Francisco Yacht Club. The proposal won the recommendation of the Parks, Open Spaces and Lanes Committee by a 4-0 vote on Aug. 21, with member Marika Bergsund absent.</p>
<p>The cost of purchasing and installing the fountain would be covered by Marin Women’s Hall of Fame naturalist and photographer Joan Bekins, Belvedere’s 2017 Citizen of the Year Emerita, and her husband, Don.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nicholas Schoichet has turned his passion for board games into a community-building mission across Marin County.</p>
<p>“Get in here, lose a game, look like a fool, have fun,” says the 35-year-old Tiburon resident, one of the leading figures of Marin Board Games, a community group that meets for gaming nights at least twice a month in Terra Linda.</p>
<p>Schoichet, who also runs a monthly board-game design group at the Starbucks in the Strawberry Village shopping center, says he loves a high-quality board game — whether it can be taught in five minutes or is more nuanced and “gives you a perspective on something that you were not thinking about.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The $25 bows can be mailed out, but for those who live locally, the Kaplans can assemble, deliver and install the bow on a donor’s property.

     <description>Sal Bonavita, Alfred Peet&apos;s hand-picked successor who owned Peet&apos;s Coffee in the 1980s, died at 84 in Belvedere.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere resident Sal Bonavita, a businessman whose career as a coffee and tea importer led him to become Alfred Peet’s hand-picked successor at Peet’s Coffee, died at his home July 28 following complications related to dementia. He was 84.</p>
<p>Bonavita owned the coffee company through the mid-1980s after purchasing it from company namesake Alfred Peet in 1979. The New York Times called Peet the “leader of a coffee revolution” in his 2007 obituary. Peet founded the coffee shop in Berkeley in 1966 and continued to work alongside Bonavita as a consultant on maintaining his high standards for coffee and tea after selling the company.</p>
<p>Before acquiring Peet’s, Bonavita had built his career as an importer by the end of the 1970. He sold specialty teas and coffees, Italian espresso machines and other accessories to luxury department stores across the U.S.</p>
<p>After selling Peet’s to Starbucks co-founder Jerry Baldwin in 1984, Bonavita continued to consult for coffee roasters, such as Sonoma County-based Wolf Coffee Co. He also had his own coffee venture, the now-closed Bonavita Coffee and Tea Co. in Mill Valley.</p>
<p>Healdsburg residents and Wolf Coffee founders Richard and Jeanne Mariani said Bonavita was a mentor to them when they founded their coffee company in 1990 on both roasting and operating fronts.</p>
<p>“He provided just this attention to quality and attention to detail in every step of the process,” Jeanne Mariani said.</p>
<p>John Weaver was hired by Bonavita to work at Peet’s Coffee in 1980 and later became its master roaster. He left in 2007 to start San Rafael-based Weaver’s Coffee and Tea.</p>
<p>Weaver said Bonavita became “one of the best experts in the world” because Peet mentored him. Weaver includes his coffee-making heritage, featuring Peet and Bonavita, on his coffee-bean bags and roasts one blend using the same 1905 model of roaster Peet used as an homage to the two.</p>
<p>“I didn’t realize how special, till later, that what I was being taught was,” Weaver said, calling Bonavita a “legendary” figure.</p>
<p>Early life and family</p>
<p>Salvatore Alexander Bonavita was born Jan. 6, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York, to Anthony Bonavita and Rita Limoncelli. Raised in Brooklyn, he was the couple’s only child and the grandson of Italian immigrants.</p>
<p>He was married twice. First to Odette Sarkis, whom he met when he picked up her older brother and his college roommate. The couple moved to the Tiburon Peninsula in 1975, where...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A visiting artist tries to be mindful as can be</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-visiting-artist-tries-to-be-mindful-as-can-be</link>
     <description>El Cerrito artist Jim Vecchi visits Tiburon by chance, sharing how his MS diagnosis inspired an 8-year video project.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jim Vecchi ended up visiting Tiburon last week by pure luck.</p>
<p>The 69-year-old El Cerrito resident was planning a trip into San Francisco thinking it would be warm, then wandered to Tiburon Aug. 20 because the city was too cold. He eventually settled on relaxing in Fountain Plaza.</p>
<p>“It’s just so beautiful to be by the waterside here,” he says.</p>
<p>He’s not a total stranger to the area. Vecchi previously lived in Fairfax and grew familiar with Tiburon and its restaurants, visiting “quite often.” This visit marks his first in roughly 18 months.</p>
<p>While Vecchi said he enjoyed Marin’s nature while in Fairfax, the county’s lack of diversity wasn’t great for him. Living closer to Berkeley and Oakland provides him “a whole different scene.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere raises ADU height limit on steep lots for faster approvals</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-raises-adu-height-limit-on-steep-lots-for-faster-approvals</link>
     <description>Belvedere approves streamlined permits for taller backyard housing units on sloped properties.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere will soon allow property owners to build 25-foot accessory dwelling units on steep lots with rubber-stamp approval.</p>
<p>The City Council tentatively approved revisions to its accessory-unit ordinance — which include other increased height limits, modified front-yard setback requirements, expanded amnesty for unpermitted units and allowing up to eight detached units on multifamily properties — in a 4-0 vote Aug. 11, with Councilmember Peter Mark absent.</p>
<p>A second reading for formal adoption is tentatively scheduled for Sept. 8, after which the new rules would take effect 30 days later.</p>
<p>The revisions are primarily housekeeping, updating Belvedere’s municipal code to reflect statewide accessory-unit laws that took effect in January. The most significant local decision extends a new 25-foot height limit to detached units on lots with slopes exceeding 30%, going beyond state requirements that apply only to attached units.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon girls tackle new territory with flag football</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-girls-tackle-new-territory-with-flag-football</link>
     <description>Two Tiburon girls turn yearlong campaign into reality, launching Redwood&apos;s first girls&apos; varsity flag football team with 30 players.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Redwood High School students Lauren Van Dusen and Juliet McNamara were watching this year’s Super Bowl at Lauren’s home when a commercial caught their attention.</p>
<p>In the “Flag 50” ad, a female flag-football player runs down the field under stadium lights. She dodges, leaps and twists her way past the opposing players, finally dashing into the end zone as the crowd crescendos into a roar. The ad concludes with the words: “Let’s make girls’ flag football a varsity sport in all 50 states.”</p>
<p>The ad resonated with the 16-year-old Tiburon residents because they were in the midst of campaigning to start a girls’ flag-football team at Redwood, where both are juniors.</p>]]></content:encoded>
