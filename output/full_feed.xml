     <title>Tiburon panel wants community feedback for positive-message street-sign art</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-panel-wants-community-feedback-for-positive-message-street-sign-art</link>
     <description>Tiburon considers street-sign art with positive messages, but pushback prompts officials to seek more feedback and artist revisions.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon arts officials want more community feedback on a proposed public-art project — and more details from the artist — after his positive-message street-sign concept drew less-than-positive responses on social media.</p>
<p>The Heritage and Arts Commission voted 6-0 July 22, with member Azita de Mujica absent, to request a refined proposal from Los Angeles artist Scott Froschauer for “The Word on the Street.” The commission also will seek input from the Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission, homeowners associations, the Public Works Department and other stakeholders once the detailed proposal is ready.</p>
<p>The commission urged community members to attend its next meeting Aug. 26 to discuss the project. No approval has been granted, as the project would need approval from the parks commission and Town Council.</p>
<p>“It’s important that we share with the community the concepts — different kinds of public art,” Commissioner Victoria Fong said. “And it’s OK if they don’t like it — it gets them talking, it’s communication, which is the purpose.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Be Ready Belvedere will host its first major emergency-preparedness event in October, teaching residents how to build go-bags as part of the city’s efforts to improve disaster readiness.</p>
<p>In her July 14 report to the City Council, working-group chair and Councilmember Pat Carapiet provided a five-point disaster-preparedness checklist for residents and announced the “Build a Go Bag” event, set for 5-6 p.m. Oct. 10 at Community Park ahead of the Belvedere Home-Made Film Festival, which starts at 6:30.</p>
<p>The Be Ready Belvedere group originated from a mission last fall to revise the city’s formal emergency operations plan, but it shifted focus to community education when members identified a need for clearer public guidance.</p>
<p>“One of the most frequent questions we have from the community is, ‘What do I do in event of an emergency?’” Carapiet said at the meeting. “There is a feeling that they don’t know what to do, that: ‘Is there plan? What do I do?’”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A former tennis player finds new passion for pickleball</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-former-tennis-player-finds-new-passion-for-pickleball</link>
     <description>At 83, Tiburon resident Robert Moore stays active playing pickleball, adapting to new challenges after rotator-cuff surgery.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Moore visits the Lagoon Road tennis courts twice a week to practice his pickleball serve and exercise.</p>
<p>The 83-year-old Tiburon resident, a longtime former recreational tennis player, took up pickleball several years ago for a second chance on the courts after rotator-cuff surgery limited his ability to make overhand shots.</p>
<p>“Very rarely does the ball come up high as opposed to tennis,” Moore says during a July 23 practice session. The plastic ball used for pickleball has less of a bounce than a tennis ball, he says.</p>
<p>Moore moved to Tiburon in 2010 after spending most of his life in southern New Jersey, where he worked 35 years as a social studies teacher. He and his wife came to California because they were tired of flying west four or five times a year to visit their two children.</p>
<p>While he misses the South Jersey coast — “you can always go on the water from about June to October” — Moore says Tiburon has the weather advantage the rest of the year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>June 30, 1933 – July 7, 2025   Golda Clarkin Boeck, beloved mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, aunt, and community pillar, passed...</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>June 30, 1933 – July 7, 2025</p>
<p>Golda Clarkin Boeck, beloved mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, aunt, and community pillar, passed away peacefully at the age of 92 on July 7, 2025. Born June 30, 1933, to Joseph and Golda Clarkin in Denver, Colorado, Golda was a gifted pianist from an early age, and began performing by 12. She studied Finance with a minor in Music and Literature at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and graduated on the Dean’s List. After college, she worked in Chicago, eventually settling in the Bay Area with her husband, Lawrence Boeck.</p>
<p>For over five decades, Golda made her home in Belvedere, where she raised her family and became a treasured presence in the community. Her life was defined by her devotion to music, her passion for service, and her deep commitment to family. Golda took pride in her work as a real estate broker for over 45 years. She was involved in many civic and musical endeavors — directing and accompanying local theater productions, serving on music committees and fundraising boards, and welcoming new neighbors with her signature hospitality and homemade gifts.</p>
<p>She was Iconic — always elegant and engaged with friends as well as the mah jong, bridge and book club groups whose ages spanned generations. Golda infused holidays and occasions with care and attention, creating meals and moments that brought people together with warmth and style.</p>
<p>She passed on her deep love of the outdoors, her remarkable work ethic, and a strong sense of independence to her children. She encouraged an active life filled with purpose, adventure, and time in nature, including skiing, tennis, swimming, boating, and simply being outdoors.</p>
<p>Golda is predeceased by her step-siblings Joe and Mary, and her younger brother Paul. She is survived by her son, Larry Boeck (Susanna), and grandsons Daniel (Ariella), Eli, and Thomas (and partner Haley); her daughter, Cynthia Boeck Hardy (John), and granddaughters Carina (and partner Tavish) and Chiara; two great-grandchildren, Ellery and Alder Boeck; and beloved nieces, nephews, and their families.</p>
<p>The family is ever thankful to her dedicated caretakers, Gina, and recently, JayVee, and to the numerous friends who brought her much joy. She is certainly writing you all thank you notes as you read this! She will be remembered for her wisdom, humor, generosity, and as a woman of extraordinary capability — someone who made those around her feel seen, valued, and de...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tsunami alert upgraded to advisory for Tiburon Peninsula after Russia earthquake</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tsunami-alert-upgraded-to-advisory-for-tiburon-peninsula-after-russia-earthquake</link>
     <description>Tsunami advisory in effect for Tiburon Peninsula after 8.7 quake off Russia. Residents urged to avoid beaches and waterways.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Note: The MarinOffice of Emergency Managementissued a notice at 10:55 a.m. July 30 that the warning has been canceled.</p>
<p>The Tiburon Peninsula is under a tsunami advisory following an 8.7-magnitude earthquake that struck near Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula at 4:25 today, July 29.</p>
<p>A tsunami watch initially issued for the West Coast wasupgraded to an advisoryabout 6:30 p.m. for California, with the National Weather Service warning residents to stay away from beaches and waterways until further notice. The advisory is the middle level of the warning center’s three-tier alert system: watch, advisory and warning.</p>
<p>Should a tsunami materialize, it would hit San Francisco overnight, at 12:40 a.m. July 30. In the Bay Area, the weather service is forecasting peak tsunami wave heights at less than 1 foot and can arrive as a series of waves or surges over several hours. No evacuations are advised at this time.</p>
<p>“Stay away from the water! Stay away from beaches and waterways! Remain away from shore until local officials say that it is OK to return,” theNational Weather Service Bay Areawarned on social media.</p>
<p>“If you are located in this coastal area, move off the beach and out of harbors and marinas,” the weather service said in the advisory. “Do not go to the coast to watch the tsunami. Be alert to instructions from your local emergency officials.”</p>
<p>The advisory means dangerous currents and waves are possible but does not indicate the widespread destruction associated with a tsunami warning, the highest alert level.</p>
<p>Marin County residents should register for Alert Marin, the county’s emergency notification system that delivers critical information during disasters, viaalertmarin.org. The free service sends alerts by phone, text, email or smartphone app to registered users when evacuation or other emergency actions are required. Updates are also available at theMarin Public Emergency Portal.</p>
<p>AlertMarin allows registration of up to five addresses including home, work and schools. Listed landline numbers are automatically included, but cellphones and internet-based phone services require manual registration.</p>
<p>If emergency sirens sound on the Tiburon Peninsula, residents should tune to 840AM for emergency information broadcasts. The SNAP radio system — Siren Notification Alerting the Peninsula — provides real-time updates when the peninsula is cut off from outside resources or faces immediate danger.</p>

     <description>Rezoning is still needed for full compliance, California housing agency officials say</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After three failed attempts and 2½ years out of compliance, Belvedere has won tentative approval for its housing plan pending rezoning changes city officials expect to complete by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The California Department of Housing and Community Development’sJuly 16 letterto Belvedere says the fourth draft of its2023-2031 housing elementmeets all statutory requirements but cannot be considered in substantial compliance until city officials formally adopt the underlying zoning that would allow the new housing to be built.</p>
<p>Belvedere was required to plan for at least 160 new units — up from 16 in the previous eight-year cycle — as part of California’s goal of 2.5 million new homes by 2030 and Plan Bay Area 2050’s regional target of 441,176 units. The city’s share includes 77 for lower incomes, 23 for moderate incomes and 60 for above-moderate incomes. The extra 28 units provide a buffer in case some sites are not developed to projected capacities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Bartender’s cheat sheet from Tiburon Tommie’s unearthed, revealing long-lost recipes from the iconic tiki bar’s heyday.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Debbie Selby sorted through her late father’s belongings earlier this month, she expected to find a few mementos from his bartending days. What she discovered was a treasure trove of cocktail history — long-lost drink recipes from Tiburon Tommie’s, the legendary tiki bar that helped define downtown for nearly four decades.</p>
<p>Tucked among John McAllister’s personal items was a bartender’s cheat sheet containing not just the restaurant’s famed mai tai recipe but originals and local twists on several other cocktails previously thought lost to time: the Pier 41 Awful, with banana, rum, half-and-half and anise; the Paradise cocktail, a tikified version of a gin-and-juice classic; and the ever-popular scorpion, a shared behemoth served in a bowl with a half-bottle champagne float.</p>
<p>“I really thought I would just find it on the scrap of paper — and then to find the whole cheat sheet, I was like, ‘Oh my goodness,’” says Selby, who grew up on Tiburon’s Claire Way and now lives in Corte Madera.</p>
<p>McAllister served as one of the original bartenders at the Polynesian-themed Tiburon Tommie’s, which operated at 41 Main St. from 1958 to 1995. The mai tai, famous for its inclusion of apricot brandy, became so popular that owner Tommy Cox renamed the restaurant from Tiburon Tommie’s Pier 41 to Tiburon Tommie’s Mai Tai in 1963.</p>
<p>The recipe has its own place in local lore and has since been preserved by the Belvedere-Tiburon Landmarks Society: equal parts lemon, orange and pineapple juices, gold and dark rums and the apricot brandy.</p>
<p>McAllister spent about a decade bartending at Tiburon Tommie’s, from its opening until about 1970, when he left following a heart attack, Selby said. Previously, he’d also been a mainstay of the small original bar that Cox operated as Tommy’s Pier 41, even creating that establishment’s tagline of “Look for fun at Pier 41,” according to a 2017 Landmarks retrospective.</p>
<p>Selby said her father, who died in 1998 at age 64, likely took home the cheat sheet to have as a reference for making drinks at home or impressing friends at parties. She immediately posted her findings to a Facebook group called Tiburon Native, receiving an enthusiastic response from members who didn’t realize the recipes still existed.</p>
<p>The 65-year-old said the post received replies like, “This is incredible” and “I’m going to make it right away.”</p>
<p>“I just took the picture, and it kind of went from there,” Selby said. “Everybo...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Most Tiburon Peninsula special districts fail website transparency rules, grand jury finds</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/most-tiburon-peninsula-special-districts-fail-website-transparency-rules-grand-jury-finds</link>
     <description>A Marin grand jury report reveals most Tiburon Peninsula agencies do not meet state transparency website standards. Only one agency fully complies.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most agencies serving the Tiburon Peninsula fail to meet state transparency requirements for their websites, an analysis by The Ark found following a June 27 Marin civil grand jury report.</p>
<p>The report “Who’s Minding the Store?” found that only seven of 56 sites for special districts and joint powers authorities countywide complied with transparency laws. The grand jury primarily criticized Marin County for inadequate oversight, saying the remaining websites were operating “without consequence.”</p>
<p>Only one agency exclusively serving the peninsula — Sanitary District No. 5 of Marin — met all eight state requirements in The Ark’s analysis.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A retired publicist in Tiburon finds ‘liberation’ in his Chevy Corvette</title>

     <description>For Tiburon’s Mike Scippa, driving his naturally aspirated V8 Corvette is more than speed — it’s about freedom and connection.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon resident Mike Scippa polishes his cherry red 2006 Chevrolet Corvette parked along the water at Shoreline Park on the afternoon of July 16, the muscle car’s paint glistening in the sun.</p>
<p>While he declines to share the top speed he’s reached in the vehicle — “I plead the Fifth,” he says. “I don’t want to incriminate myself” — he says the naturally aspirated V8 brings the car to life. For muscle-car enthusiasts, that’s doing it the honest way, without forced air from superchargers or turbos.</p>
<p>“The acceleration, the pure power,” he says. “It’s a different dynamic. You gotta be careful.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>In Memory of Joyce (Hill) Tayer</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/in-memory-of-joyce-hill-tayer</link>
     <description>Joyce (Hill) Tayer died peacefully on July 12 in her home from complications related to bone marrow cancer. She was 93.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joyce (Hill) Tayer, a long-time resident of Tiburon, California, and wife of deceased former mayor of Tiburon Donald Tayer, died peacefully on July 12 in her home from complications related to bone marrow cancer. She was 93.</p>
<p>Joyce grew up in North Bergen, New Jersey, a suburb of New York City. She graduated from Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and then received her master’s degree from Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education. It was there, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that she met the love of her life, Donald S. Tayer, who was studying at Harvard Law School. While in Boston, Joyce taught in the public elementary schools in Newton. After their Harvard graduations, Joyce and Donald moved to New York City where their children, Lisa and Marc, were born. In 1959, the Tayer family moved to San Francisco, where Joyce became an educator, training student teachers at San Francisco State University, and Donald became an attorney and partner at the San Francisco law firm still known as Beeson, Tayer & Bodine.</p>
<p>In 1964, the Tayer family moved across the Golden Gate Bridge to Tiburon, where Joyce lived for the remainder of her life. She became an artist, specializing in hand-made paper woven on a loom with fiber, and exhibiting for many years with the Marin art group Fibermania. She and Donald enjoyed the cultural arts of San Francisco and the Bay Area, and loved to travel within the U.S. and to numerous places around the world. For many years, Joyce and Donald enthusiastically attended the Carmel Bach Festival and the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland.</p>
<p>Joyce is survived by her daughter, Lisa (Tayer) Lance; her son-in-law, Les Lance; her grandson Tucker Lance; and by her son, Marc Tayer; her daughter-in-law, Wendy (Gorlin) Tayer; and her grandchildren Madeleine, Melanie, and Jason Tayer.</p>

     <title>David R. Albert</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/david-r-albert</link>
     <description>David R. Albert of Tiburon passed away peacefully on January 13, 2025, at the age of 89.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>November 23, 1935 –January 13, 2025</p>
<p>David R. Albert, a longtime Tiburon resident, passed away peacefully on January 13, 2025, at the age of 89. He will be remembered for his warmth, generosity, and deep love of family, nature, and community.</p>
<p>Born in Riverside, California, David graduated from UCLA on a Navy scholarship and served as a U.S. Navy pilot, achieving the rank of Lieutenant Commander. He went on to a distinguished career in commercial aviation, flying internationally for Pan American World Airways and later Delta Airlines. His calm professionalism and steady presence in the cockpit earned him the respect of colleagues around the world.</p>
<p>After retiring from aviation in 2003, David embraced life in Tiburon, where he and his wife, Joyce Bell, shared a home overlooking open space. He found daily joy in observing wildlife, hiking local trails, and spending time in nature.</p>
<p>David was deeply involved in the local community. He served as president of the Rotary Club of Tiburon (2009-2010) and volunteered with the Broom Busters, helping maintain local open spaces by removing invasive plants. Whether through formal service or quiet acts of kindness, David gave generously of his time and heart.</p>
<p>A man of many talents, David spoke several languages, played the guitar, and had a beautiful singing voice. He took up karate at age 60 and earned a 4th-degree black belt by 74, a testament to his discipline and love of learning. He and Joyce traveled widely — from the Galápagos to the Trans-Siberian Railway —but he was equally at peace in his own backyard, appreciating the simple beauty of the natural world.</p>
<p>David is survived by his wife, Joyce Bell; his stepchildren, Marc Malnekoff (Julie), Mara Malnekoff (Gregg), and Marnie Malnekoff; and his grandchildren, Beck and Avi Franklin. He was a beloved husband, stepfather, grandfather, and friend.</p>
<p>David’s legacy lives on in the many lives he touched — with kindness, thoughtfulness, and a deep sense of presence. He will be deeply missed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon says it won’t cooperate with ICE amid federal crackdown</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-says-it-won-t-cooperate-with-ice-amid-federal-crackdown</link>
     <description>The Town Council will consider a sanctuary resolution in August, while the police chief says officers would seek to verify agent IDs.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon officials have confirmed the town will not assist with any immigration-enforcement efforts as President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill provides historic funding for federal immigration enforcement and deportation of undocumented immigrants nationwide.</p>
<p>“We’re not assisting in any way, shape or form with ICE,” Police Chief Michelle Jean said July 15. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement may still come to town and “do what they want to do, but we’re not going to assist them.”</p>
<p>Tiburon Mayor Holli Thier said the Town Council would vote Aug. 6 on a sanctuary resolution amid ongoing federal actions.</p>
<p>“As mayor, I will not allow the town of Tiburon to cooperate with ICE,” Thier said while commending the Police Department’s policy to not work with the immigration agency. “We want everyone in Tiburon to feel safe, respected and to live free from fear.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Report: Tiburon and Belvedere will likely miss state’s housing targets for 2031</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/report-tiburon-and-belvedere-will-likely-miss-state-s-housing-targets-for-2031</link>
     <description>Civil grand jury says economic hurdles outweigh local opposition, posing major challenges for Marin communities.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon and Belvedere will almost certainly fail to meet ambitious state housing mandates requiring the construction of 639 and 160 units respectively by 2031, according to a Marin civil grand jury report that blames economics rather than community resistance for the projected shortfall.</p>
<p>The June 24 report “The Worrisome Future of Marin Housing” found that Marin County and all 11 of its cities and towns will likely fall short of building a combined 14,405 housing units by 2031 under the current state allocation. The targets represent a 526% increase from the 2,298 units previously allocated between 2015 and 2023, when neither Tiburon nor Belvedere met their housing goals. During that fifth cycle, Tiburon achieved only 36% of its goal while Belvedere reached 63%. The two communities were among only three of 12 Marin jurisdictions that failed to meet their targets, along with San Rafael.</p>
<p>Housing leaders told grand jury members that “significant cost challenges that make building housing financially unattractive” present the primary obstacle, including high interest rates, labor and construction costs, local and state building codes and “a lack of available land” for for-profit developers, the report said. Affordable-housing developers face those same restrictions plus limited rental rates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>A rendering shows plans for the 2.84-acre, 40-unit Mallard Pointe redevelopment between Belvedere City Hall and the lagoon. Its fast-track application was deemed complete in June 2022 but took more than three years to win approval, facing significant community opposition. A Marin civil grand jury report, however, cited economic obstacles rather than local pushback as the primary reason why state-mandated housing development across Marin won’t meet eight-year targets.

     <description>Belvedere moves to fill police staffing gaps by hiring a retiring officer’s replacement and multiple reserves to ease chronic understaffing.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere is seeking to replace one inactive full-time police officer and hire multiple reserves to ease chronic understaffing that has left four officers working 12-hour shifts and overtime to maintain 24/7 coverage.</p>
<p>City Manager Robert Zadnik told the City Council July 14 that the hiring process is already underway, with Police Chief Jason Wu confirming July 21 that three applicants have met minimum qualifications and are doing initial ride-alongs ahead of formal interviews.</p>
<p>The full-time position became available after Sgt. Tom Sabido announced his retirement effective in September, freeing a slot tied up by his medical leave, while the reserve officer positions could provide quicker relief amid ongoing staffing shortages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Artist’s View open space in Belvedere to get overlook</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/artist-s-view-open-space-in-belvedere-to-get-overlook</link>
     <description>Belvedere approves Artist’s View platform to expand public access and island views, using grant funds despite neighbor concerns over fire risk and cost.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere will build a new viewing platform at Artist’s View open space off the southern tip of the island, a project some six years in the making.</p>
<p>The Planning Commission at its July 15 meeting voted 4-1 in favor of creating the new lookout point, with Ghazaleh Jamei dissenting after criticizing the design. The decision came after feedback from several residents who supported the idea of creating a spot to pause and reflect on the view and from others who expressed concerns about litter and fire danger.</p>
<p>The project, spearheaded by the city’s Parks, Open Spaces and Trails Committee, calls for a curved platform to be built off Belvedere Avenue at the top of Artist’s View, a city-owned site that runs between 1 Blanding Lane and 475 Belvedere Ave.</p>]]></content:encoded>
