     <title>Most Tiburon Peninsula special districts fail website transparency rules, grand jury finds</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/most-tiburon-peninsula-special-districts-fail-website-transparency-rules-grand-jury-finds</link>
     <description>A Marin grand jury report reveals most Tiburon Peninsula agencies do not meet state transparency website standards. Only one agency fully complies.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most agencies serving the Tiburon Peninsula fail to meet state transparency requirements for their websites, an analysis by The Ark found following a June 27 Marin civil grand jury report.</p>
<p>The report “Who’s Minding the Store?” found that only seven of 56 sites for special districts and joint powers authorities countywide complied with transparency laws. The grand jury primarily criticized Marin County for inadequate oversight, saying the remaining websites were operating “without consequence.”</p>
<p>Only one agency exclusively serving the peninsula — Sanitary District No. 5 of Marin — met all eight state requirements in The Ark’s analysis.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A retired publicist in Tiburon finds ‘liberation’ in his Chevy Corvette</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-retired-publicist-in-tiburon-finds-liberation-in-his-chevy-corvette</link>
     <description>For Tiburon’s Mike Scippa, driving his naturally aspirated V8 Corvette is more than speed — it’s about freedom and connection.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon resident Mike Scippa polishes his cherry red 2006 Chevrolet Corvette parked along the water at Shoreline Park on the afternoon of July 16, the muscle car’s paint glistening in the sun.</p>
<p>While he declines to share the top speed he’s reached in the vehicle — “I plead the Fifth,” he says. “I don’t want to incriminate myself” — he says the naturally aspirated V8 brings the car to life. For muscle-car enthusiasts, that’s doing it the honest way, without forced air from superchargers or turbos.</p>
<p>“The acceleration, the pure power,” he says. “It’s a different dynamic. You gotta be careful.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>In Memory of Joyce (Hill) Tayer</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/in-memory-of-joyce-hill-tayer</link>
     <description>Joyce (Hill) Tayer died peacefully on July 12 in her home from complications related to bone marrow cancer. She was 93.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joyce (Hill) Tayer, a long-time resident of Tiburon, California, and wife of deceased former mayor of Tiburon Donald Tayer, died peacefully on July 12 in her home from complications related to bone marrow cancer. She was 93.</p>
<p>Joyce grew up in North Bergen, New Jersey, a suburb of New York City. She graduated from Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and then received her master’s degree from Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education. It was there, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that she met the love of her life, Donald S. Tayer, who was studying at Harvard Law School. While in Boston, Joyce taught in the public elementary schools in Newton. After their Harvard graduations, Joyce and Donald moved to New York City where their children, Lisa and Marc, were born. In 1959, the Tayer family moved to San Francisco, where Joyce became an educator, training student teachers at San Francisco State University, and Donald became an attorney and partner at the San Francisco law firm still known as Beeson, Tayer & Bodine.</p>
<p>In 1964, the Tayer family moved across the Golden Gate Bridge to Tiburon, where Joyce lived for the remainder of her life. She became an artist, specializing in hand-made paper woven on a loom with fiber, and exhibiting for many years with the Marin art group Fibermania. She and Donald enjoyed the cultural arts of San Francisco and the Bay Area, and loved to travel within the U.S. and to numerous places around the world. For many years, Joyce and Donald enthusiastically attended the Carmel Bach Festival and the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland.</p>
<p>Joyce is survived by her daughter, Lisa (Tayer) Lance; her son-in-law, Les Lance; her grandson Tucker Lance; and by her son, Marc Tayer; her daughter-in-law, Wendy (Gorlin) Tayer; and her grandchildren Madeleine, Melanie, and Jason Tayer.</p>
<p>Donations in memory of Joyce Tayer can be made to Marin Theatre,https://purchase.marintheatre.org/Donations, and Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco,https://donate.famsf.org.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>David R. Albert</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/david-r-albert</link>
     <description>David R. Albert of Tiburon passed away peacefully on January 13, 2025, at the age of 89.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated:9 minutes ago</p>
<p>November 23, 1935 –January 13, 2025</p>
<p>David R. Albert, a longtime Tiburon resident, passed away peacefully on January 13, 2025, at the age of 89. He will be remembered for his warmth, generosity, and deep love of family, nature, and community.</p>
<p>Born in Riverside, California, David graduated from UCLA on a Navy scholarship and served as a U.S. Navy pilot, achieving the rank of Lieutenant Commander. He went on to a distinguished career in commercial aviation, flying internationally for Pan American World Airways and later Delta Airlines. His calm professionalism and steady presence in the cockpit earned him the respect of colleagues around the world.</p>
<p>After retiring from aviation in 2003, David embraced life in Tiburon, where he and his wife, Joyce Bell, shared a home overlooking open space. He found daily joy in observing wildlife, hiking local trails, and spending time in nature.</p>
<p>David was deeply involved in the local community. He served as president of the Rotary Club of Tiburon (2009-2010) and volunteered with the Broom Busters, helping maintain local open spaces by removing invasive plants. Whether through formal service or quiet acts of kindness, David gave generously of his time and heart.</p>
<p>A man of many talents, David spoke several languages, played the guitar, and had a beautiful singing voice. He took up karate at age 60 and earned a 4th-degree black belt by 74, a testament to his discipline and love of learning. He and Joyce traveled widely — from the Galápagos to the Trans-Siberian Railway —but he was equally at peace in his own backyard, appreciating the simple beauty of the natural world.</p>
<p>David is survived by his wife, Joyce Bell; his stepchildren, Marc Malnekoff (Julie), Mara Malnekoff (Gregg), and Marnie Malnekoff; and his grandchildren, Beck and Avi Franklin. He was a beloved husband, stepfather, grandfather, and friend.</p>
<p>David’s legacy lives on in the many lives he touched — with kindness, thoughtfulness, and a deep sense of presence. He will be deeply missed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon says it won’t cooperate with ICE amid federal crackdown</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-says-it-won-t-cooperate-with-ice-amid-federal-crackdown</link>
     <description>The Town Council will consider a sanctuary resolution in August, while the police chief says officers would seek to verify agent IDs.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon officials have confirmed the town will not assist with any immigration-enforcement efforts as President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill provides historic funding for federal immigration enforcement and deportation of undocumented immigrants nationwide.</p>
<p>“We’re not assisting in any way, shape or form with ICE,” Police Chief Michelle Jean said July 15. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement may still come to town and “do what they want to do, but we’re not going to assist them.”</p>
<p>Tiburon Mayor Holli Thier said the Town Council would vote Aug. 6 on a sanctuary resolution amid ongoing federal actions.</p>
<p>“As mayor, I will not allow the town of Tiburon to cooperate with ICE,” Thier said while commending the Police Department’s policy to not work with the immigration agency. “We want everyone in Tiburon to feel safe, respected and to live free from fear.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Report: Tiburon and Belvedere will likely miss state’s housing targets for 2031</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/report-tiburon-and-belvedere-will-likely-miss-state-s-housing-targets-for-2031</link>
     <description>Civil grand jury says economic hurdles outweigh local opposition, posing major challenges for Marin communities.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon and Belvedere will almost certainly fail to meet ambitious state housing mandates requiring the construction of 639 and 160 units respectively by 2031, according to a Marin civil grand jury report that blames economics rather than community resistance for the projected shortfall.</p>
<p>The June 24 report “The Worrisome Future of Marin Housing” found that Marin County and all 11 of its cities and towns will likely fall short of building a combined 14,405 housing units by 2031 under the current state allocation. The targets represent a 526% increase from the 2,298 units previously allocated between 2015 and 2023, when neither Tiburon nor Belvedere met their housing goals. During that fifth cycle, Tiburon achieved only 36% of its goal while Belvedere reached 63%. The two communities were among only three of 12 Marin jurisdictions that failed to meet their targets, along with San Rafael.</p>
<p>Housing leaders told grand jury members that “significant cost challenges that make building housing financially unattractive” present the primary obstacle, including high interest rates, labor and construction costs, local and state building codes and “a lack of available land” for for-profit developers, the report said. Affordable-housing developers face those same restrictions plus limited rental rates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>A rendering shows plans for the 2.84-acre, 40-unit Mallard Pointe redevelopment between Belvedere City Hall and the lagoon. Its fast-track application was deemed complete in June 2022 but took more than three years to win approval, facing significant community opposition. A Marin civil grand jury report, however, cited economic obstacles rather than local pushback as the primary reason why state-mandated housing development across Marin won’t meet eight-year targets.

     <description>Belvedere moves to fill police staffing gaps by hiring a retiring officer’s replacement and multiple reserves to ease chronic understaffing.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere is seeking to replace one inactive full-time police officer and hire multiple reserves to ease chronic understaffing that has left four officers working 12-hour shifts and overtime to maintain 24/7 coverage.</p>
<p>City Manager Robert Zadnik told the City Council July 14 that the hiring process is already underway, with Police Chief Jason Wu confirming July 21 that three applicants have met minimum qualifications and are doing initial ride-alongs ahead of formal interviews.</p>
<p>The full-time position became available after Sgt. Tom Sabido announced his retirement effective in September, freeing a slot tied up by his medical leave, while the reserve officer positions could provide quicker relief amid ongoing staffing shortages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Artist’s View open space in Belvedere to get overlook</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/artist-s-view-open-space-in-belvedere-to-get-overlook</link>
     <description>Belvedere approves Artist’s View platform to expand public access and island views, using grant funds despite neighbor concerns over fire risk and cost.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere will build a new viewing platform at Artist’s View open space off the southern tip of the island, a project some six years in the making.</p>
<p>The Planning Commission at its July 15 meeting voted 4-1 in favor of creating the new lookout point, with Ghazaleh Jamei dissenting after criticizing the design. The decision came after feedback from several residents who supported the idea of creating a spot to pause and reflect on the view and from others who expressed concerns about litter and fire danger.</p>
<p>The project, spearheaded by the city’s Parks, Open Spaces and Trails Committee, calls for a curved platform to be built off Belvedere Avenue at the top of Artist’s View, a city-owned site that runs between 1 Blanding Lane and 475 Belvedere Ave.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Jazz guitarist returning home for Old St. Hilary’s concert July 25</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/jazz-guitarist-returning-home-for-old-st-hilary-s-concert-july-25</link>
     <description>Tiburon native Perry Smith will perform with his trio New West Guitars July 25 at Old St. Hilary’s Landmark.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guitarist Perry Smith starts each day with a cold plunge.</p>
<p>Hooking a refurbished air conditioner up to a large barrel, Smith cools the water down to 40 degrees, then sits in it for six minutes.</p>
<p>“It helps me musically and helps me mentally,” he says. “It sharpens my body and mind and improves my technique and stamina on the guitar.”</p>
<p>Smith follows up the tingly cold plunge with 150 pushups, 150 bicycle crunches, 20 minutes of jump rope, 100 more pushups and 10 minutes of stretching. Then he picks up his guitar — a custom Mirabella archtop — and hammers away for 60 minutes on technique, improvisation, recording and honing his repertoire and sight reading.</p>
<p>This regimented approach has allowed Smith, 42, to build more than two decades of success as a jazz musician. The Tiburon native will perform with his trio New West Guitars July 25 at Old St. Hilary’s Landmark in a concert hosted by the Belvedere-Tiburon Landmarks Society — a sweet homecoming for the Brooklyn-based jazz guitarist whose career has brought him all around world.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Haines grew up living in several countries due to his father’s work in humanitarian relief.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throw a dart at a world map, and chances are David Haines has visited there, from Virginia, Seattle, New York and Washington, D.C., to Malaysia, Singapore, Switzerland, France, Italy, the U.K., Guatemala and Peru.</p>
<p>Having traveled the world, Haines, 75, says he feels grateful to have called Tiburon home for some 45 years.</p>
<p>“I count my blessings every day for the opportunity to live here,” he says as he sits with his dog, Fletcher, on a bench overlooking Greenwood and Brunini beaches near Blackie’s Pasture on July 9. “I mean, I couldn’t pick a more beautiful place in the world, and I’ve seen a lot of beautiful places.”</p>
<p>Haines grew up living in several countries due to his father’s work in humanitarian relief, helping those affected by disasters and building orphanages. Whenever disaster struck, “he would mobilize volunteers and people he recruited — engineers, nurses, doctors, whatever needed — to go into an area and help rebuild it,” Haines says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Travel Bug: Mediterranean cruise crosses continents and cultures</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/travel-bug-mediterranean-cruise-crosses-continents-and-cultures</link>
     <description>Over 11 days, the Travel Bug explored two continents and four countries, immersing ourselves in rich culture and history while celebrating a milestone anniversary.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Gaudí’s whimsical architecture in Barcelona and the red-and-white arches of Córdoba’s Great Mosque to the soaring Gothic cathedral of Seville and the vibrant souks of Marrakesh, our Windstar cruise from Barcelona to Lisbon fed my husband’s and my wanderlust in every way. Over 11 days aboard the intimate Star Legend, we explored two continents and four countries — Spain, Gibraltar, Morocco and Portugal — immersing ourselves in rich culture and history while celebrating a milestone anniversary.</p>
<p>We began our journey with a blissfully relaxing sea day, a much-needed pause after the hustle of getting to Barcelona. We buzzed around the city for two full days to take in Gaudí’s masterpieces, including the awe-inspiring Sagrada Família and his whimsical home-turned-museum. Once aboard the ship, the pace shifted. I slipped easily into vacation mode, rotating between naps, reading, grazing at the buffet and lounging by the pool. Others booked spa treatments, played dominoes or joined enriching onboard lectures.</p>
<p>The Star Legend, a luxury small ship with only 156 suites and a maximum of 312 guests, felt intimate and friendly. We weren’t the only ones celebrating something special. Birthdays, retirements, anniversaries — almost every table had a story. On our second night, we toasted with Dave and Jenny, a retired couple from North Carolina who were on their third Windstar cruise. As we sailed along Spain’s glittering coast, it was easy to see why they kept coming back.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere probes cyberattack as report warns of rising risks</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-probes-cyberattack-as-report-warns-of-rising-risks</link>
     <description>The May 28 breach occurred just a month before a Marin civil grand jury report about vulnerabilities across the county&apos;s independent networks.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere is investigating a May cybersecurity incident that prompted the city to temporarily shut down its servers and network systems as officials work to determine whether any sensitive data was compromised.</p>
<p>The May 28 breach occurred just one month before the Marin County civil grand jury released a June 27 report documenting two major cyberattacks since 2024 that cost local agencies nearly $1 million and exposed vulnerabilities across the county’s independent networks.</p>
<p>City Manager Robert Zadnik said officials have identified the type of cyberattack but declined to share additional details, citing security risks. The city is working with the California Intergovernmental Risk Authority to investigate the incident, including whether any resident data or financial information was compromised.</p>
<p>“It was an annoying inconvenience,” Zadnik said. “But also an opportunity to see where some vulnerabilities may lie and make improvements.”</p>
<p>He said the investigation is expected to wrap up in a couple of months and that he hopes to update the City Council later this summer or in early fall.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Redwood&apos;s John Anderluh was named an All-Academic honoree, and Lucy Jeffers is an All-American.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two Tiburon teens have earned honors from USA Lacrosse for their standout 2025 seasons.</p>
<p>John Anderluh, who graduated from Redwood High School in May, was named an All-Academic honoree by the organization, which governs men’s and women’s lacrosse across the U.S., while Lucy Jeffers, a rising Redwood senior, was named an All-American honoree.</p>
<p>Anderluh and Jeffers were each one of 500 student-athletes to earn the recognition in their respective categories.

     <title>Pandemic piano hobby turns into a Billboard-charting music career</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/pandemic-piano-hobby-turns-into-a-billboard-charting-music-career</link>
     <description>Her single “Move Your Body Slowly&quot; reached No. 26 on Billboard’s adult-contemporary chart.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon resident Rongrong Souang began teaching herself piano during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, watching YouTube clips to learn chords.</p>
<p>Her husband, however, challenged her to learn on her own, so she wouldn’t be influenced by other styles. She finally decided to give it a try — if only to prove him wrong and put an end to what she says is the only real argument they’ve ever had.</p>
<p>“Let me show you that I really can’t do this today,” she recalls telling her husband. “I’m going to give it a very honest try on it. I will give my best effort, sit at the piano and try to write something. If I can’t, let’s just drop it so we don’t have to fight anymore.”</p>
<p>That same day, she wrote three songs.</p>
<p>Today, the 37-year-old Souang is a budding pop singer who goes by the stage name Miist, with songs that have appeared on — and topped — Billboard and other music-industry charts. Her single “Move Your Body Slowly,” an infectious dance-pop track with a music video filmed at a Belvedere Avenue mansion, reached No. 26 on Billboard’s adult-contemporary chart. The same song hit No. 1 on the indie adult-contemporary chart organized by Mediabase, a music-industry metrics tracker.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: An ad sales rep has an open-door policy for his Belvedere garage office</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters</link>
     <description>Ed Meagher has been working remotely from his open-door “man cave” since he and his wife moved into their Belvedere Land Co.-owned home three years ago.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those walking down San Rafael Avenue near Community Park on weekdays may notice resident Ed Meagher sitting at his computer in his open garage, faint rock music emanating into the street. Concert posters from The Fillmore line the walls, and a stout bulldog sits at his feet.</p>
<p>Meagher was working out of the garage July 1, just as he does every workday, leaving the garage door open even during the winter.</p>
<p>“I have an option of closing this door and being locked in here,” he says. “But I’d much rather have it open and see people all day long.”</p>
<p>Meagher is an advertising sales rep who has been working remotely from his open-door “man cave” since he and his wife moved into their Belvedere Land Co.-owned home three years ago. Since then, he has gained a reputation in the neighborhood, especially among dog walkers who often stop to chat while their canine counterparts receive treats.</p>]]></content:encoded>
