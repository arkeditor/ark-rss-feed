     <description>Tiburon to remove invasive weeds at Railroad Marsh after condo residents report rat infestation linked to overgrown vegetation behind units.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will remove invasive weeds and plants behind Point Tiburon Marsh condominiums after residents complained the overgrown vegetation is contributing to a rat infestation — a renewed attempt at maintenance after work was halted in October 2023 when a biologist spotted what was believed to be a threatened California red-legged frog.</p>
<p>Lafayette-based DK Environmental & Construction Services Inc. will begin removing emerging aquatic weeds, invasive blackberry bushes and other nonaquatic vegetation this month along the southern edge of Railroad Marsh, which sits off Mar West Street behind the Belvedere-Tiburon Library, Tiburon Town Hall and the 34-unit condo complex on Marsh Road.</p>
<p>That 2023 maintenance work to clear 750 tons of cattails was roughly 70% complete but did not resume following the work stoppage, leaving part of the marsh overgrown. The California red-legged frog is listed as threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Strawberry journalist creates studio to capture life stories on film</title>

     <description>Journalist Priya David Clemens launches studio to create personal documentaries. Her first film profiles Tiburon surgeon Angelo Capozzi.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strawberry resident and longtime journalist Priya David Clemens decided to honor her father ahead of his 75th birthday by creating a video of his life story to showcase at his party.</p>
<p>The response to the video was overwhelmingly positive, she says. She showed the video again at her father’s memorial service in 2024; he died at the age of 84 after battling dementia for two years and, at the time of his death, was unable to recall or share many of his memories, she says.</p>
<p>After the memorial screening, Clemens says she was approached by many attendees with the same sentiment: “I wish I had this for my mom or my dad. I wish that I could do something like this.”</p>
<p>The experience prompted Clemens to createKeepsake Studios, a business that creates personal documentaries of people, couples and families for special occasions.The company’s first completed documentary is of Tiburon resident Angelo Capozzi, the 92-year-old plastic surgeon who cofounded Rotaplast, a nonprofit that provides surgery to children with a cleft lip or palate anomalies who otherwise would not receive treatment. Since 1992, the organization has conducted 372 missions to perform surgery on nearly 22,000 patients.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Local officials plan microgrid connecting Town Hall and library for emergency power during natural disasters and public safety shutoffs.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon Town Hall and the Belvedere-Tiburon Library would serve as a combined community resilience center with backup power for residents during major outages caused by natural disasters under a plan now being developed by local officials.</p>
<p>Engineers from the Bay Area Regional Energy Network visited both Tiburon Boulevard buildings in mid-September to conduct an energy roadmap assessment. It will analyze what infrastructure is needed to keep both buildings operational during emergencies. Community resilience centers coordinate services and distribute resources before, during and after natural disasters through power systems that keep heating, cooling and lighting operational during outages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounter: A couple savors the moment on shores of Richardson Bay</title>

     <description>Wade and Norleak Winblad find tranquility along Richardson Bay, reflecting on simple living and appreciating everyday moments.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wade and Norleak Winblad dip their toes into Richardson Bay near Greenwood Cove Drive Sept. 24, savoring a quiet moment in camping chairs along the water’s edge.</p>
<p>Wade says the water temperature is not as cold as he expected.</p>
<p>“It just makes me want to jump in and go swimming out there,” he says — though he resists the urge. “I know when you get past your waist or so, it’s a whole different world.”</p>
<p>The Corte Madera couple, married 11 years, were seeking relief from last week’s muggy mini heat wave. Wade says soaking their feet in the water is therapeutic. The week’s temperatures reached the high 80s Sept. 23 and the high 70s the following day — mild for Norleak, who hails from Cambodia.</p>
<p>“It’s like 100 degrees every day there,” she says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Apple design icon Jony Ive buys four Belvedere homes for $73 million</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/apple-design-icon-jony-ive-buys-four-belvedere-homes-for-73-million</link>
     <description>The off-market deal includes historic Locksley Hall, now twice Marin’s priciest-ever sale.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Off-market deal includes historic Locksley Hall, now twice Marin’s priciest-ever sale</p>
<p>By TYLER CALLISTER and KEVIN HESSEL</p>
<p>Billionaire designer Jony Ive quietly purchased four Belvedere Island homes for $73 million last month, including the $43.5-million Locksley Hall mansion — itself the largest residential sale in Marin County since the historic home was last sold a decade ago.</p>
<p>Better known locally as the Blanding House, the three-story, 9,235-square-foot home at on Golden Gate Avenue sits atop the city’s southern peak and features sweeping 270-degree views of the San Francisco skyline and Golden Gate and Bay bridges.</p>
<p>The package also included two flanking properties, the $14.62-million Organ House once part of the larger Blanding estate and another Golden Gate Avenue home for $6.9 million, as well as a $7.98-million home below on Beach Road that sits on Belvedere Cove.</p>
<p>Transaction records show all four sales closed Aug. 28.</p>
<p>Ive, best known for his tenure as Apple’s chief product designer, apparently acquired the properties through a privately brokered, off-market transaction from venture capitalist Matt Cohler.</p>
<p>Cohler purchased Locksley Hall for a record-setting $47.5 million in August 2015 under an LLC, then scooped up the others under different LLCs in June and December 2021. All were linked to Apercen Partners, a Palo Alto-based tax-consulting firm that has represented executives and alumni of Facebook and its parent, Meta.Federal Elections Commission records show that includes Cohler.After helping to launch LinkedIn, Cohler was one of Facebook’s five original employees and its vice president of product sales. As a venture capitalist, he has backed Dropbox, Instagram and Tinder.</p>
<p>It's unclear what Ive intends to do with the properties.</p>
<p>“Sorry to be so unhelpful, but this would be a ‘decline to comment’ I’m afraid,” his communications chief, Sarah O’Brien, said in a Sept. 24 email.</p>
<p>Ive famously designed the colorful original iMacs and the iPhone, joining Apple in 1992 and becoming the design chief in 2015. After leaving in 2019, he co-founded LoveFrom, a “creative collective” that has worked on industrial design, technology and branding with Ferrari, Airbnb and ChatGPT creator OpenAI.</p>
<p>In July, OpenAI completed its $6.4 billion acquisition of Ive’s AI hardware startup, io Products, with Ive and LoveFrom poised to design a line of AI-enabled devices. Before the acquisition ann...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>The Tiburon Police Department will conduct impaired driving enforcement operations Sept. 26 and 27.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Police Department will conduct two impaired driving enforcement operations this week, with an overnight DUI checkpoint and saturation patrols.</p>
<p>The checkpoint will run 8 p.m. Sept. 26 to 3 a.m. 27 at an undisclosed location, according to a news release. Officers will then conduct saturation patrols from 7 p.m. 27 to 3 a.m. 28, actively looking for drivers suspected of driving under the influence.</p>
<p>DUI checkpoint locations are determined based on data showing incidents of impaired driving-related crashes, the department said.</p>
<p>Impaired driving extends beyond alcohol. Some prescription medications and over-the-counter drugs may interfere with driving. While medicinal and recreational marijuana are legal, driving under the influence of marijuana remains illegal.</p>
<p>Drivers charged with a first-time DUI face an average of $13,500 in fines and penalties, as well as a suspended license.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Tiburon officials agreed with only one of nine findings in a Marin grand jury report on housing mandates, following Belvedere&apos;s lead.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon officials agreed with only one of nine findings in a Marin civil grand jury report that criticized local jurisdictions for not doing enough to meet state housing mandates, following Belvedere’s lead from earlier this month.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously Sept. 16 to approve its formal response to the grand jury’s June report titled “The Worrisome Future of Marin Housing,” which will be signed and returned by Town Manager Greg Chanis. The Marin Board of Supervisors, Tiburon and the county’s 10 other incorporated municipalities were required to respond by Sept. 24.</p>
<p>The grand jury report blames “economic reality” rather than local resistance in asserting that all Marin jurisdictions, including Tiburon, will fall short of meeting state housing mandates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At 50, Arthur Drooker’s life took a dramatic turn. His father had recently died, and his three-decade career as a Los Angeles TV writer and producer was getting stale. He longed for something deeper.</p>
<p>Dooker says his next choice was the best decision he ever made.</p>
<p>“I realized if there’s anything I really want to do with my life, I’ve got to do it now,” says Drooker, who stopped to chat Sept. 17 while on a bike ride at Shoreline Park. “And I was always a very self-motivated guy, but I was even more motivated now. And that’s when I decided, ‘What makes me happy?’”</p>
<p>For Drooker, now 71, the answer was photography.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Rose Marie “Posie” Anderson died July 28, 2025.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rose Marie “Posie” Anderson will be remembered for her kindness, generosity, and dedication to her family and friends. Her life was marked by her devotion to classical piano music and her love of all things beautiful. She was well-known as a dynamic member of the Marin community, where she lived and taught piano lessons in her home for more than 50 years. She also served as the organist for the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Belvedere, where she was a long-time member.</p>
<p>Posie was born Rose Marie Reed on June 22, 1933, in Springfield, Missouri, where she grew up and attended Southwest Missouri State University and earned a bachelor’s degree in music. She married William “Bill” Boyd, and the young couple moved to California and started a family with a daughter, Becky and a son, Brett.</p>
<p>Posie and Bill Boyd later divorced, and in 1980 she married Willard “Bill” Anderson of Belvedere. Poise and Bill enjoyed a fairytale marriage for nearly 37 years, sharing their love for each other and their passion for music and travel. Bill Anderson passed away in 2017 at the age of 99.</p>
<p>Posie passed away peacefully in the presence of family on July 8, 2025, and is survived by her daughter, Becky Boyd; her son, Brett Boyd; daughter in-law Odette Boyd; and grandsons Max Boyd and Blake Boyd. A Celebration of Life will be held in her remembrance on October 4, 2025, at 1 PM at Marin Covenant Church, 195 N. Redwood Drive, San Rafael, CA.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Late actor, filmmaker Robert Redford had long ties to Tiburon</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/late-actor-filmmaker-robert-redford-had-long-ties-to-tiburon</link>
     <description>Robert Redford lived on Tiburon&apos;s Ridge Road in the late 1990s and early 2000s, returning to Mar East Street from 2020 to 2024.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To his Tiburon friends and neighbors, late Hollywood legend Robert Redford was simply “Bob” — the friendly guy who loved dogs, jogged around town and would strike up conversations about where people were from, never mentioning his own storied career.</p>
<p>“That is how we always knew him,” said resident Jeff Turnbaugh, who met Redford during walks around town. “It never came up that he was Robert Redford, and I never, ever asked anything about it — and obviously I knew.”</p>
<p>Redford, who died at his Utah home Sept. 16 at age 89, had local ties dating back some six decades. Dad Charles Redford Sr., who retired as an accounting manager for Chevron’s oil refinery in Richmond, lived in Tiburon from the early 1970s until his death in 1991.</p>
<p>Redford himself lived on Ridge Road in the late 1990s and early 2000s before moving to Calistoga and St. Helena. With artist wife Sibylle Szaggars Redford, he returned to Mar East Street in 2020 before relocating to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 2024, where she has an art gallery and together they ran an arts nonprofit promoting global conservation efforts.</p>
<p>The actor and Academy Award-winning director became one of Hollywood’s leading men in the 1960s and 1970s with starring roles in films like “The Candidate,” “Jeremiah Johnson,” “The Natural,” “The Sting,” and “All the President’s Men,” which is being screened Sept. 24-28 at Cinelounge in downtown Tiburon in honor of Redford.</p>
<p>He won an Oscar in 1981 for directing “Ordinary People,” which also won best picture that year, and received another nomination for “Quiz Show” in 1995. “The Sting” earned him a best-actor Academy Award nomination in 1974.</p>
<p>Redford’s impact extended beyond acting and directing. He founded the nonprofit Sundance Institute in 1981, which runs the Sundance Film Festival, the largest independent film festival in the U.S. Films like “American Psycho,” “Napoleon Dynamite,” “Whiplash” and “CODA,” which won the Oscar for best picture, have all premiered at Sundance.</p>
<p>Local connections span decades</p>
<p>Charles Robert Redford Jr. was born Aug. 18, 1936, in Santa Monica. Though he grew up in California, he became rooted in Utah after marrying historian and activist Lola Van Wagenen in 1958, later calling Los Angeles phony and superficial. They had four children — the eldest died of whom died at 2½ months — and divorced in 1985.</p>
<p>Redford’s most recent stay in Tiburon came during a difficult period for his family. He and ...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere officials are pushing back against a Marin civil grand jury report that criticizes local jurisdictions for failing to meet state housing goals, with Mayor Jane Cooper calling it a “one-size-fits-all” approach that ignores the city’s unique circumstances.</p>
<p>In a 4-0 vote Sept. 8, the City Council approved a formal response that disputed six of nine findings in the grand jury’s June report titled “The Worrisome Future of Marin Housing.” The legally required response will be signed by Cooper and returned to the grand jury.</p>
<p>“One of the most problematic issues with (the California Department of Housing and Community Development) that we face in Marin is their one-size-fits-all laws for everyone, no matter the size of the community or amount of land,” Cooper said at the meeting. “And now the grand jury is doing the same thing without regard for the individual differences, with statements such as ‘all Marin cities and towns should.’”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Richardson Bay agency halts housing-voucher program amid federal funding cuts</title>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Richardson Bay’s few remaining anchor-outs may have lost their chance at subsidized onshore housing after the agency that manages the bay put its rental assistance program on hold.</p>
<p>The Marin Housing Authority in May asked the Richardson Bay Regional Agency to stop accepting applicants into its temporary-support housing program, saying it could no longer offer the federal vouchers meant to provide long-term rental assistance.</p>
<p>“We do not have the vouchers to proceed with the remaining people on the anchorage,” said Marin Housing Authority Executive Director Kimberly Carroll, citing “budget issues with the federal government.”</p>
<p>The request became public last week as part of the agency board’s Sept. 11 meeting.</p>
<p>The agency program, funded by a $3 million state grant, provides temporary one-year housing vouchers to anchor-outs living on boats on Richardson Bay who wish to move ashore. The program has been key to clearing derelict boats off the bay.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon fire officials adopt $16.7-million budget with funds for construction, upgrades</title>

     <description>Board adopts spending plan as construction begins on Paradise Drive fire station replacement.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Fire Protection District adopted a $16.7 million budget for fiscal 2025-2026 that includes $3.6 million toward the remodel of its Paradise Drive station, where construction began earlier this month. The budget also includes repairs and upgrades to the district’s downtown station.</p>
<p>The district’s board of directors voted 4-0 at its Sept. 10 meeting to approve the break-even budget, with board member Cheryl Woodford absent. The budget showed minimal changes from a preliminary budget approved in June, ahead of the July 1 start of the new fiscal year.</p>
<p>The remodel of Station 10 on Paradise Drive at Trestle Glen Boulevard accounts for about 22% of the district’s total anticipated expenditures in fiscal 2026. The project has been in the works for several years. The station was originally built in the 1960s as a two-stall facility for volunteer firefighters and has since expanded to about 4,000 square feet to include living quarters for on-duty staff and additional fire apparatus.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Medical professionals from New Hampshire and Southern California discover friendship in Marin.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>San Rafael resident Janessa Bowen (left) and new Tiburon resident Hannah Cashman have known each other for 2½ years, meeting through their jobs as an ultrasound technician and an X-ray technician, respectively.</p>
<p>Hannah Cashman says she’s enjoying her new stomping grounds after moving to Tiburon from Novato about three weeks ago.</p>
<p>She says she’s been enjoying the views and that she can walk to downtown from her new residence.</p>
<p>“I liked the aspect of being close to the city because I grew up in such a small town in New Hampshire that this is so big for me, and I love it,” Cashman says. “I love the outdoor life, but then I can also cross that bridge and have that city life.”</p>
<p>Cashman was hanging out with friend and San Rafael resident Janessa Bowen at Shoreline Park on Sept. 9. The two have known each other for roughly 2½ years through their work; Cashman is an X-ray technician, and Bowen is an ultrasound technician.</p>]]></content:encoded>
