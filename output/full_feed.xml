     <title>Tiburon to hire designer for neighborhood park upgrades</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-to-hire-designer-for-neighborhood-park-upgrades</link>
     <description>The work will focus on neighborhood miniparks at Cypress Hollow Park, Belveron Mini Park and the Bel Aire play area.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon plans to hire a landscape designer to explore updates for its neighborhood miniparks at Cypress Hollow Park, Belveron Mini Park and the Bel Aire play area, continuing the town’s directive to upgrade its parks.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously June 18 to approve a request for proposals to design the spaces. Community feedback for all parks indicated a need for greater maintenance and upkeep, with parks commissioners noting resident support for a new swing set for all children instead of the current toddler-only swings at Cypress Hollow Park, two to three benches at the Bel Aire space and removing flammable trees at Belveron Mini Park.</p>
<p>Public Works Engineering Manager David Eshoo said after the meeting that the timeline is in its early stages, but he hopes the Town Council can approve a design by September with Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission approval beforehand.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>This is the second attempt in recent years to develop Artist’s View.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A plan to build a new lookout point for the Artist’s View open space off the southern tip of Belvedere Island will head to the Planning Commission next month.</p>
<p>The project, spearheaded by the city’s Parks, Open Spaces and Trails Committee, calls for a curved platform with three benches to be built off Belvedere Avenue at the top of Artist’s View, a city-owned site that runs between 1 Blanding Lane and 475 Belvedere Ave. The parks commission on June 12 voted unanimously to forward the project to the Planning Commission, which is expected to review and vote on the plan at its July 15 meeting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Arts commission explores proposal for positive-message street signs across town</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/arts-commission-explores-proposal-for-positive-message-street-signs-across-town</link>
     <description>One red, octagonal sign says “start” instead of “stop.” Others feature a red circle with a solid bar saying “celebrate mistakes” instead of “do not enter.”</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon officials are considering a public-art project featuring imitation street signs with positive messaging.</p>
<p>The Heritage and Arts Commission voted 4-1 June 18 to gather more information about Los Angeles artist Scott Froschauer’s proposal for “The Word on the Street” before recommending funding. Commissioner Nora Noguez dissented, and Commissioners Liz Feibusch and Azita de Mujica were absent.</p>
<p>If backed by the arts commission, the project would need approval from the Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission and the Town Council.</p>
<p>The signs wouldn’t be placed in “spaces that are dangerous to automobile traffic,” such as roadsides or locations that could appear to lead toward roads from a distance, Froschauer wrote in his proposal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon teens Charlie Scott and Nick Hartung were each awarded a $2,500 National Merit Scholarship, recognizing their academic accomplishments and leadership abilities, as well as their potential to succeed in a rigorous college program.</p>
<p>Charlie and Nick, who graduated from Redwood High School earlier this month, were among just three students in Marin County and 2,500 nationwide to be awarded the prestigious 2025 scholarship through National Merit’s own funds. Their honors were announced in May.</p>
<p>Some 1.5 million high-school juniors nationwide took the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test in October 2023 as an initial screening for the National Merit Scholar program, with 16,000 students advancing as semifinalists after they became seniors. Semifinalists were then required to write an essay and detail activities, awards and leadership roles, had to be endorsed by a high-school official and then earn SAT and ACT scores that confirmed their test performance. Some 15,000 students met the academic standards to become finalists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Both say they’d consider professional sports if the lemonade industry turns sour.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sixth-grader Harry Hamilton says the amount of money he makes at his lemonade stand is a secret.</p>
<p>“It depends on the day,” he says. “It depends on how many walkers are out.”</p>
<p>Situated on the trail along Richardson Bay on June 18, Harry and his business partner, classmate Cole Peters, stand behind a white table blanketed with their merchandise: Hefty cups, clear pitchers of lemonade and a tray of cookies.</p>
<p>Harry says they’re popular due to the boys’ special recipe.</p>
<p>“It’s made from scratch. … Well, actually it’s from a package,” he says, though they add real lemons to make the juice “more lemony.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Bruce Charles Auld, 82, of Tiburon passed away peacefully at home on June 4, 2025.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bruce Charles Auld, 82, of Tiburon passed away peacefully at home on June 4, 2025. He is survived by his daughters, Ashley Auld-Fisher and Allie Auld-Hill; his grandchildren, Caroline Auld and William Auld-Hill; and his sister, Esther Ross. He is preceded in death by his beloved wife, Martha Auld, with whom he now rests in peace.</p>
<p>Born on February 13, 1943, in Seattle, Washington, Bruce lived a rich and full life defined by curiosity, craftsmanship, faith, and deep love for his family. Throughout his childhood, you would often find him sequestered in the basement of his family home building with erector sets, perfecting the knots he learned in Boy Scouts (and later Eagle Scouts), and teaching his niece and nephews (who lovingly called him “Uncle Chuck”) about math and science. Bruce also played football for the Queen Anne High School Grizzlies, and got into Columbia University on a track scholarship.</p>
<p>At Columbia, he earned his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, and his master’s in seismology. After school, he worked in geophysics and later started a small business providing field testing and analysis services. It was during this time that he met and fell in love with Martha. After a four-year courtship, they married on his birthday in 1977, and he built their forever home in the town of Tiburon, where they settled down to raise their family.</p>
<p>In his free time, he enjoyed tinkering with the latest (’80’s and ’90’s) computer technology, playing “King’s Quest” with his daughters, camping, fishing, playing the piano, and volunteering as a youth soccer coach. He was a gifted handyman that could fix nearly anything, insisting that no job was too big to tackle himself. He loved to garden, and enjoyed finding creative ways to transform his food surplus into meals and baked goods that he donated to the homeless. He has also served as a member of the vestry at St. Stephen’s Episcopal Church in Belvedere, where he dedicated his free time to keeping their services and computers running smoothly. He continued this work into his retirement, where he became an active Bridge player, opera goer, and crossword-puzzle addict. He also enjoyed relaxing with Martha on their back porch in Kauai, and fishing at Lake Powell.</p>
<p>His celebration of life memorial will be held at St. Stephen’s Episcopal Church in Belvedere/Tiburon on Aug 16, 2025, at 3:00 pm. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in support of the church he ...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon adopts $26 mil budget with focus on parks and open space</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-adopts-26-mil-budget-with-focus-on-parks-and-open-space</link>
     <description>At least $1.14 million is allocated for amenities and upgrades in fiscal 2025-2026.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon has adopted a $25.97-million budget that prioritizes its parks and open spaces, with at least $1.14 million allocated for amenities and upgrades in fiscal 2025-2026 and an additional $500,000 dedicated to its fund for future improvements.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously at its June 18 meeting to formally approve the budget, which showed no changes from the draft reviewed by the council earlier this month. The vote was part of the consent calendar, typically reserved for bulk approval of items deemed noncontroversial.</p>
<p>For fiscal 2025-2026, which begins July 1, the town is planning for $18.25 million in operating expenditures against $18.27 million in operating revenue, leaving a nearly $20,000 surplus. That doesn’t include the town’s $6.47 million capital-improvement program and $1.25 million in debt-services programs on equal revenue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon Town Council divided in bike-lane letter to Caltrans</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/council-divided-in-bike-lane-letter-to-caltrans</link>
     <description>Tiburon officials want to see safety revisions in the first phase, and Caltrans is mulling its options.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated:24 minutes ago</p>
<p>Tiburon officials have asked Caltrans to address the impacts of planned Tiburon Boulevard bike lanes on safety, public transit, school buses and traffic, with an agency representative confirming June 23 that it was “coordinating with the town of Tiburon and discussing several options internally.”</p>
<p>The Town Council had voted 3-2 to send the 143-word letter, with Mayor Holli Thier and Councilmember Jack Ryan dissenting, afternearly three hoursof public comment and discussion June 18. Ryan wants the entire bike-lane segment between Blackfield Drive and Trestle Glen removed, while Thier said without further elaboration that the letter didn’t address all her safety concerns.</p>
<p>At a special June 4 forum with councilmembers, Southern Marin Supervisor Stephanie Moulton-Peters and residents, Caltrans had said the$12.7-million preventive-maintenance projectmust proceed as planned because of funding deadlines and concerns that winter storms could further damage the deteriorating roadway. The agency announced the project would come intwo phases, with the original plan as phase one.</p>
<p>In its presentation, the agency initially signaled it was open to revisions — phase one included “work with community and stakeholders,” next steps were to “update plans for phase one” and said “we want to hear from you” — but it became clear as the meeting progressed that any major revisions were planned for phase two.</p>
<p>The project as it stands</p>
<p>The yearlong first phase, to start in 2026, would repave the 4.6 miles of state-owned Highway 131 from Mill Valley city limits to Tiburon Boulevard’s intersection with Main Street, upgrading drainage systems, guardrails, curb ramps, signs, traffic signals, lighting, crosswalks and intersections. Officials also said the plan would now incorporate afiber-optic broadband conduitat Tiburon’s request and preserve medians that would have been eliminated.</p>
<p>For the bike lanes, a multiuse path would connect East Strawberry Drive to Greenwood Cove Drive, which serves as the current bike route to the Old Rail Trail. Otherwise, there would be separated and protected Class-4 bikeways west of Blackie’s Pasture to the south and west of Reed Ranch Road to the north. A one-block segment of standard Class-2 bike lanes would stretch from Reed Ranch to Jefferson Drive, connecting to an existing protected path to Trestle Glen Boulevard.</p>

     <media:description>Caltrans plans to add protected Class-4 bikeways for most of the Tiburon Boulevard project in 2026, though protected lanes were assessed and deemed &quot;infeasible&quot; for a segment between Reed Ranch Road and Jefferson Drive over infrastructure concerns and are curently planned as standard, unprotected Class-2 bike lanes under Caltrans implementation guidelines. However, Caltrans now says new the Class-2 lanes will be upgraded to Class-4 in the second phase of the project in 2027-2028. The lanes will connect to the existing path in the curve to Trestle Glen, which already sits off the road behind a guardrail. The Safe Routes to Schools path will remain on Greenwood Beach Drive.

     <description>Tiburon’s Audrey MacLean, 19, is first female runner between 10 and 33 to win the nation’s oldest trail race.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Audrey MacLean had long been obsessed with the Dipsea Race, the nation’s oldest trail race, since she first learned about it as a seventh grader.</p>
<p>She first ran the race in the summer before eighth grade, though she notes at the time she “wasn’t that good at running.”</p>
<p>That’s since changed. The Tiburon resident, now 19, was crowned the winner of the 114th Dipsea Race on June 8 with a time of 46 minutes, 28 seconds — 20 seconds ahead of runner-up Mark Tatum and 1 minute, 41 seconds ahead of third-place finisher and defending champion Chris Lundy.

     <description>Several factors are driving the projected deficit, including rising special-education costs, increased personnel costs and a funding gap for foundation-sponsored programs.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Reed Union School District is projecting a $1.83-million deficit in fiscal 2026 as it provides 5% raises to its teachers and staff and plans to spend an extra $1.18 million to close a funding gap for the arts, library and technology programs partially funded by the Foundation for Reed Schools.</p>
<p>The district’s board of trustees voted unanimously at its June 10 meeting to approve the $33.15-million budget against $31.51 million in revenue for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, which begins July 1.</p>
<p>While the district is projecting slight increases in its major sources of revenue, property and parcel taxes, it’s not expecting that to be enough to keep pace with its expenditures next year and will dip into its reserves to make up the difference.</p>
<p>Chief Business Official Chris Kim said several factors are driving the projected deficit, including rising special-education costs, increased personnel costs and the funding gap between the $1.75 million raised by the foundation and the estimated $2.93-million cost of its sponsored programs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>New Business: Istanbul natives bring Troya Mediterranean restaurant to Cove</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/new-business-istanbul-natives-bring-troya-mediterranean-restaurant-to-cove</link>
     <description>In May, the Kinalilars opened Troya restaurant in The Cove shopping center, serving Turkish and Mediterranean fare.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When husband-wife duo Berk and Betul Kinalilar would speak with Marin diners visiting their 19-year-old San Francisco restaurant,Troya, they’d often receive the same comment: “Open the restaurant in Marin.”</p>
<p>Living in the most diverse and dense culinary city in the nation, they said the request didn’t make much sense.</p>
<p>“We didn’t know anything about this area,” Betul says.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until they moved to Marin in 2018, and to Corte Madera on New Year’s Eve 2020, that they noticed that sit-down options for Turkish or Mediterranean were few.</p>
<p>“Now, it makes sense,” Betul says. “Tiburon and Marin needs more Mediterranean.”</p>
<p>So the Kinalilars acted on what their customers had been telling them all along. In May, they opened a second Troya restaurant serving Turkish and Mediterranean fare in The Cove shopping center, replacing fried-chicken sandwich shop Flybird. The restaurant served its first meal May 1 and expanded dinner service to Sundays through Thursdays on June 15.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A Tiburon man’s youth included driving a queen and hijinks on the river</title>

     <description>Burkett, who turned 93 on June 15, served in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War, achieving the rank of commander.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing up in Lodi, Roy William “Bill” Burkett once had the distinction of driving around a queen — the Grape Queen, that is.</p>
<p>The title was bestowed on a woman annually from 1934 to 1980 during the September Lodi Grape Festival, a celebration of the region’s grape harvest.</p>
<p>The queen was selected based on “beauty, poise and personality,” with the winner frequently chosen ahead of time and featured in promotional materials, according to a 2004 retrospective published in the Lodi News-Sentinel.</p>
<p>The honor of driving the queen around was a big deal, but Burkett didn’t have to do much to land the job.</p>
<p>“I knew the guy that was in charge,” the Tiburon resident says while hanging out in Zelinsky Park on June 11 with friend Hannah Callaway of Berkeley. Now he’s the one getting the rides. Callaway told Burkett she’s “lucky enough to get to come and help you in your house and drive you around places.”</p>
<p>“She didn’t want to say she’s filling in as a caregiver,” Burkett says of Callaway’s help.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere: State poised to accept latest housing plan</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-state-poised-to-accept-latest-housing-plan</link>
     <description>City officials say HCD &quot;has indicated its informal approval of the proposed revisions&quot; to the 188-unit 2023-2031 housing element.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Note: This story was updated June 18 to reflect the printed edition.</p>
<p>Belvedere’s fourth attempt at an eight-year housing plan has the tentative green light from Sacramento, local officials say.</p>
<p>The city posted the479-page revised draft to its websiteJune 11 for the required seven-day public-comment period. It was expected to submit the plan to the California Department of Housing and Community Development for formal 60-day review as soon as week.</p>
<p>The draft makes no changes to the 188-unit site inventory included in the third draft of November 2024 and instead focuses on “sharpening the pencil,” Councilmember Peter Mark said in an interview, as it mostly clarifies and tweaks policies and programs at the state’s request, such as updated rezoning and development incentives.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, (the department) has indicated its informal approval of the proposed revisions, signaling that the changes address all remaining issues,” City Manager Robert Zadnik told the City Council at itsJune 9 meeting. The most recent updates, he said, were developed in part through informal consultation with housing-agency staff.</p>
<p>Belvedere must plan for at least 160 new housing units — up from 16 in the previous eight-year cycle — as part of California’s goal of2.5 million new homes by 2030. The city’s share includes 77 for lower incomes, 23 for moderate incomes and 60 for above-moderate incomes.The extra 28 units in the plan are a buffer in case some sites are not developed to projected capacities.</p>
<p>The 2023-2031 housing element was supposed to be in place 2½ years ago, by Jan. 31, 2023. Of 109 Bay Area jurisdictions, Belvedere is among justsix that remain out of compliancewith state housing law. It is the only noncompliant municipality in Marin.</p>
<p>As a result, the city faces continued penalties including a “builder’s remedy” that requires streamlined approval of certain affordable housing projects regardless of local zoning. That will end with housing element certification. However, under production shortfalls it also facesSenate Bill 423 penaltiesrequiring by-right approval of certain multifamily projects through at least 2027. So far, however, no developers have attempted to use either penalty provision.</p>
<p>The housing agency’sJan. 14 rejection letterof Belvedere’s third draft contained mostly good news for city planners. The state accepted projections that 32 accessory dwelling units would be created and that 27 new units would ...</p>]]></content:encoded>
