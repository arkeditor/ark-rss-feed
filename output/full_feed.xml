     <title>Belvedere revises housing plan again, expects quick certification</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-revises-housing-plan-again-expects-quick-certification</link>
     <description>Sacramento requested one additional legal clause to fully satisfy state requirements for how cities justify their housing sites.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere made a minor tweak to its state-mandated housing plan last week that city officials say should end years of back-and-forth with Sacramento and secure certification within weeks — though the new language doesn’t quite align with recent statements from the landowner whose properties anchor the plan.</p>
<p>The City Council unanimously approved the revision to its 2023-2031 housing element Feb. 9 after the California Department of Housing and Community Development requested one additional legal clause to fully satisfy state requirements for how cities justify their housing sites.</p>
<p>Belvedere had sent the latest version for 60-day review Dec. 11, meaning the city was poised to receive formal findings by Feb. 9. However, Planning and Building Director Rebecca Markwick said that after staff met directly with state officials, the city agreed to rescind the Dec. 11 submittal, ending the risk of yet another rejection. With the council’s Feb. 9 revision in place, she resubmitted the updated version to the state housing agency Feb. 10.</p>
<p>“They should have a (findings) letter to us within a few weeks and will not use the full 60 days that they are allowed to,” Markwick said by email.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Bel Aire school will scale back partnership with diversity camp</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/bel-aire-school-will-scale-back-partnership-with-diversity-camp</link>
     <description>Participation will be limited to about 30 fourth-grade students instead of being open to any fourth grader who wants to go.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bel Aire Elementary School will continue its long-standing partnership with The Mosaic Project overnight camp next year, though participation will be limited to about 30 fourth-grade students instead of being open to any fourth grader who wants to go.</p>
<p>The Feb. 10 directive from the Reed Union School District board to maintain a scaled-down partnership with the weeklong diversity camp came after staff recommended eliminating participation in the program entirely beginning in the 2026-2027 school year. Staff has proposed replacing the camp with a campus-wide, yearlong social-emotional learning program that would include expanded counseling services, a wellness week event, service-learning opportunities and more.</p>
<p>Board members said they supported the model being developed by staff but were reluctant to fully eliminate participation in The Mosaic Project given positive feedback from families whose kids have attended in the past. The staff plan didn’t appear to offer an equivalent experience to the camp, which brings kids from varied backgrounds together in Felton, about seven miles north of Santa Cruz, to learn about diversity, empathy and conflict resolution, they said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Survey drives Belvedere lane repairs, wins council backing</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/survey-drives-belvedere-lane-repairs-wins-council-backing</link>
     <description>Projects include structural fixes, tree work, improved safety features and accessibility upgrades.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere’s historic walking lanes could soon have their first official map for residents, while a detailed survey is already steering repairs to failing stairs, missing signs and deteriorating railings on the hillside paths.</p>
<p>The Parks, Open Spaces and Lanes Committee presented its annual report to the City Council on Feb. 9, outlining a year of survey work that produced a comprehensive look at the city’s 29 historically mapped lanes — and a tracking tool that’s helping staff prioritize safety improvements.</p>
<p>Chair Charlie Harrington said the committee has focused its efforts after years of what Mayor Sally Wilkinson described as scattered priorities.</p>
<p>“In the past, it used to be loosey-goosey, wanting a million things,” Wilkinson said. “And this idea of staying very focused on a few projects has been really successful.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Competing designs for playground leave Strawberry Rec board wanting more answers</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/competing-designs-for-playground-leave-strawberry-rec-board-wanting-more-answers</link>
     <description>Members are eyeing a giant strawberry for their new playground — but they need more information before deciding which company will build it.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strawberry Recreation District board members are eyeing a giant strawberry for their new playground — but they need more information before deciding which company will build it.</p>
<p>The board on Feb. 10 heard updated presentations from Kompan and GameTime, the two firms competing for the project. Board members want cost estimates that include both custom strawberry features and off-the-shelf equipment options.</p>
<p>District General Manager Nancy Shapiro said the board also needs updated engineering information about drainage and retaining walls at the site. A final decision won’t come until April “at the earliest,” she said.</p>
<p>The playground will replace Reggie Park, a play area that was removed in 2023 to make way for pickleball and basketball courts. The new playground will be built off Belvedere Drive on a patch of grass between the tennis courts and baseball fields.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A motion designer and his dog enjoy walks in Tiburon parks</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-motion-designer-and-his-dog-enjoy-walks-in-tiburon-parks</link>
     <description>Tyson Dale has worked on broadcast and internal communications and using stop-motion, puppetry and “all animation-related things.”</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a rainy day along the Old Rail Trail near South of the Knoll Park, San Rafael resident Tyson Dale is wrapping up a lunchtime walk with his dog, Phoebe.</p>
<p>Dale brought the 2-year-old cockapoo to the Richardson Bay Lineal Park on Feb. 11 because “it’s the best place to take my dog.”</p>
<p>“She’s more energy than I thought she was going to be, but she’s great,” Dale says of Phoebe, his first dog.</p>
<p>Dale, who moved to Marin from San Francisco eight months ago, says his favorite part about dog ownership is their walks together when he’s not working as a motion designer. He says he enjoys taking her out along Tiburon’s paths and trails, which gives her a chance to chase balls around when she’s allowed to.</p>
<p>“This is as close as you can get to Golden Gate Park” without needing to brave the city traffic, Dale says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon unveils conceptual designs for parks upgrades</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-wants-feedback-on-early-conceptual-designs-for-parks</link>
     <description>Tiburon is seeking community feedback through Feb. 19 on preliminary designs for four neighborhood parks.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated:48 minutes ago</p>
<p>Early concepts to upgrade four Tiburon parks include basketball, beach volleyball and an outdoor lounge near McKegney Green, accessible play areas at Cypress Hollow Park, nature-based features at Belveron Mini Park and a new walking trail and seating at the Bel Aire play area.</p>
<p>The town’s Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission is set to discuss the concepts at a special 6 p.m. Feb. 23 meeting at Town Hall. Residents cansubmit feedback onlinethrough tomorrow, Feb. 19, or during the meeting.</p>
<p>The town last year hired Mill Valley-based RHAA Landscape Architecture and Planning to create the concepts for the former sanitation ponds site near McKegney Green and for Belveron Mini Park, with Santa Rosa-based Carlile Macy Inc. designing concepts for Cypress Hollow Park and the Bel Aire play area.</p>
<p>The preliminary designs, unveiled Feb. 10, are based on resident feedback and input from town officials, including the parks commission and Town Council.</p>
<p>Public Works Engineering Manager David Eshoo said designers will use commission and community feedback to revise plans before presenting them to the Town Council on March 18. Councilmembers will then review and provide direction before final construction documents are prepared.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Mallard Pointe gets time extension, but Belvedere rule on affordable housing stands</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/mallard-pointe-gets-time-extension-but-belvedere-rule-on-affordable-housing-stands</link>
     <description>Developer issues notices to vacate, with work targeted to start in August.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belvedere Planning Commission granted the Mallard Pointe developer a one-year extension and longer demolition window but refused to weaken the city’s strongest tool for ensuring four affordable apartments get built: requiring those units receive certificates of occupancy before or at the same time as any market-rate homes.</p>
<p>The 40-unit project at 1-22 Mallard Road, from Mill Valley-based Thompson Dorfman Partners LLC as Mallard Pointe 1951 LLC, would replace 22 existing apartments with a mix of an apartment building, townhomes, duplexes and single-family homes. Four apartments must be affordable to low- and very low-income households under state law.</p>
<p>Commissioners extended the design review approval deadline from March 19, 2026, to March 19, 2027, with corresponding extensions for later milestones. They also lengthened the demolition window from 45 to 75 days, measured from permit issuance rather than when demolition equipment appears on site.</p>
<p>But they rejected developer requests to allow market-rate units in phase one to receive occupancy permits before the apartment building containing affordable units is complete — the central dispute of the evening.</p>
<p>Four days after the commission’s approval, principal Bruce Dorfman said in a Feb. 6 email that residents have been issued notice that relocation will be required within 180 days, targeting an August construction start that will include demolition, bulkhead replacement and installation of new utilities, roadways and sidewalks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Tiburon resident Mike Ghaffary replaces Sherry Wangenheim, who resigned in December with one year left on her term.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A parent with a background in finance and a demonstrated commitment to civic service won an interim seat on the Reed Union School District board of trustees, beating out four other candidates.</p>
<p>Tiburon resident Mike Ghaffary was appointed to fill the vacancy by a 4-0 vote at a special Feb. 6 meeting.</p>
<p>He’ll replace Sherry Wangenheim, who resigned in December with one year left on her term. Wangenheim, a board member since 2017, is moving to London with her family later this year.</p>
<p>Ghaffary was set to be sworn in at the board’s Feb. 10 meeting, held after The Ark’s press deadline. He will serve the remainder of Wangenheim’s term through early December. In a Feb. 8 interview, he said he plans to run in the Nov. 3 general election to retain the seat for a full four-year term.</p>
<p>His appointment expands his local public-service commitments. Ghaffary also serves on the Tiburon Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission, a seat he has held since last March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Officials are also exploring more events, like Fourth of July and Labor Day parties.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will shut down lower Main Street in March for Little League opening day festivities and a section of Paradise Drive in May when the Tiburon Beer Festival returns after a six-year hiatus.</p>
<p>And town officials say they want to see even more celebrations in the coming year.</p>
<p>The Town Council approved the March 13 and May 30 closures in separate unanimous votes at its Feb. 4 meeting. It also unanimously approved the creation of an ad hoc subcommittee to brainstorm additional community events, including a possible July 4 celebration honoring the nation’s 250th birthday and a Labor Day parade.</p>
<p>Subcommittee members Jack Ryan and Alice Fredericks said after the meeting that any event is open for consideration, and Fredericks said the subcommittee will be looking for community members in town “with brilliant ideas” to put something together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Neighbors press for action as Belvedere again extends wall deadline</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/neighbors-press-for-action-as-belvedere-again-extends-wall-deadline</link>
     <description>Unpermitted hillside work by a prior owner still remains after six years.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six years after a previous homeowner built an illegal retaining wall at 105 Golden Gate Ave., the Belvedere Planning Commission granted another extension to current owner Tim Kasta to fix it — this time with deadlines designed to force action.</p>
<p>The commission voted 4-0 Feb. 2 to extend design review approval for a residential project that includes demolishing and rebuilding the unpermitted wall built in 2020. Vice Chair Jenna Watson recused herself due to living within 500 feet of the property.</p>
<p>This marks the third extension for the project. Staff administratively granted a one-year extension in September 2024 without commission review. The commission approved another extension in September 2025 but continued the item to allow Kasta time to submit a detailed reconstruction plan for the retaining wall.</p>
<p>The extension moves the design review expiration to Feb. 2, 2027, but commissioners added two conditions intended to accelerate the work: Kasta must apply for a building permit by July 2 and plant four coast live oaks to replace trees the previous owner removed without approval.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belveron East resident must rethink home project after pushback on second story</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belveron-east-resident-must-rethink-home-project-after-pushback-on-second-story</link>
     <description>62 neighbors signed a petition opposing the project.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Belveron East homeowner must rethink plans for a second-story addition on a corner lot after 62 neighbors signed a petition opposing the project in a neighborhood where most homes are single-story.</p>
<p>The Tiburon Design Review Board voted 4-0 at its Jan. 29 meeting, with member Jim O’Dorisio absent, to continue discussion on the proposed project at 68 Mercury Ave. They told owner Reide Baxter to return with a design that evens out the massing of the home, with member Suzanne Kim saying the current design “looks unbalanced.”</p>
<p>The petition opposed Baxter’s plan to add about 1,342 square feet onto his existing 1,250-square-foot home, including creating a 755-square-foot second floor that would have two bedrooms, a bathroom and a study. The neighbors’ letter cited the design’s “adverse impacts on views and neighborhood aesthetics” and called for Baxter to remove the second story.</p>
<p>Board members were split on whether a second story could work — Kim and colleague Phoebe Holscher said they were open to it, Chair Bryan Chong said he couldn’t support a two-story and Vice Chair Alex Rosner said he “would need a lot of convincing” to approve it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Board members were split on whether they’d support a second story in the neighborhood, though they agreed a new design with reduced massing was needed. (Wright Architecture)</media:description>

     <title>Tiburon teens lead campaigns to fight blood cancer</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-teens-lead-campaigns-to-fight-blood-cancer</link>
     <description>Zoraya Zolfaghari-Ashcroft and Amelie Mostafavi are taking part in Blood Cancer United’s Student Visionaries of the Year program.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two Tiburon teens have each launched fundraising campaigns to benefit blood-cancer research and patient-support programs.</p>
<p>Zoraya Zolfaghari-Ashcroft and Amelie Mostafavi are taking part in Blood Cancer United’s Student Visionaries of the Year program, in which teens throughout the country spend seven weeks raising money for the nonprofit while also educating their communities about blood cancers.</p>
<p>Students apply for and are accepted into the program, then work with nonprofit staff to develop a fundraising plan. They are encouraged to form a team of peers and adults to aid their fundraising efforts, which involve personal appeals as well as pitches to businesses and individuals for sponsorships. The student leader who raises the most money nationally earns the title of Student Visionary of the Year.</p>

     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/richmond-artist-uses-hands-to-tell-stories-in-tiburon-town-hall-exhibit</link>
     <description>He&apos;s now exhibiting his solo works in the downstairs lobby and council chambers through March 25.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Hightower says he’s always had a creative mind and first found an outlet by painting his clothes, decorating jackets with abstract designs and the letters “NDNIV,” or “Nature does nothing in vain,” his favorite quote from the philosopher Aristotle.</p>
<p>Hightower, 38, says he never thought of himself as a professional artist. However, after being approached twice by strangers asking to buy his jackets, he decided to see if that interest in his art would apply to paintings on canvas.</p>
<p>He began selling works out of his car in Mill Valley, and in 2023 had a piece accepted into the de Young Open. Since then, he’s exhibited in Richmond, Venice Beach, San Francisco and El Cerrito.</p>
<p>After taking part in a group show at Tiburon Town Hall last year, the Richmond-based artist is now exhibiting his solo works in the downstairs lobby and council chambers through March 25. An artist’s reception is set for 6-8 p.m. Feb. 26.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Ark investigation uncovers federal searches of Tiburon license-plate data</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/ark-investigation-uncovers-federal-searches-of-tiburon-license-plate-data</link>
     <description>In response, police chief admits 23 agencies potentially violated privacy and immigration laws when accessing system.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response, police chief admits 23 agencies potentially violated privacy and immigration laws when accessing system</p>
<p>After three months of refusing comment, Tiburon Police Chief Michelle Jean acknowledged in a Feb. 3 email that 23 agencies have conducted potentially illegal federal searches of the town’s automated license-plate camera database, including for immigration enforcement. The admission and department’s quiet December revisions to its oversight policies came in direct response to an Ark investigation that documented 475 federal searches by nine California agencies, raising significant questions about violations of state privacy laws and the town’s handling of driver data.</p>
<p>Jean called the searches an “unacceptable use of the town’s license-plate reader data,” acknowledging that California agencies “may have accessed the town’s data and potentially shared that data with federal immigration agencies” amid the Trump administration’s nationwide crackdown.</p>
<p>State law prohibits any sharing of camera data with private, out-of-state and federal agencies to protect Californians’ privacy, as well as the use of any state or local resources for federal immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>The Ark’s audit of public records from May through August — with detailed initial findings provided to Jean in October — found that the nine in-state agencies conducted searches involving the U.S. Marshals Service; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and other federal entities.</p>
<p>Jean’s acknowledgment of 14 additional agencies suggests dozens if not hundreds of additional federal searches over a longer periodthat also involved Immigration and Customs Enforcement or U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p>
<p>She stated that “the actions of the Tiburon Police Department and our authorized (automated license-plate reader) users are fully compliant” in a claim that appears to defend the department’s handling of private data while asserting Tiburon’s own officers have not conducted illegal searches. However, Tiburon redacted relevant fields for searches made by its own officers, preventing The Ark from auditing those public records.</p>
<p>Despite acknowledging the potential violations, public records show Tiburon continued to expand the number of agencies with access to its database by 45% during its internal investigation, growing from 132 to 191 since July. That includes new access for several age...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Sam’s Anchor Cafe owner purchases Silver Peso bar in Larkspur</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/sam-s-owner-purchases-silver-peso-bar-in-larkspur</link>
     <description>Peso owner Rebel Lee announced his retirement and the sale to Tiburon resident Conor Flaherty and his ownership group.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Note: This article was updated Feb. 9 with comment from new co-owner Max Perry.</p>
<p>The owner of Sam’s Anchor Cafe in downtown Tiburon is adding another iconic Marin bar to its portfolio — the 65-year-old Silver Peso in Larkspur.</p>
<p>Peso owner Rebel Lee announced his retirement and the sale to Tiburon resident Conor Flaherty and his ownership group in a video posted to the bar’s Facebook page Feb. 5. Lee said the group, Silver Peso Magnolia LLC, would take over in 30 days, or March 7, once the liquor license is transferred.</p>
<p>Flaherty — who attended Reed Union School District schools and Redwood High School in Larkspur and reportedly met his wife at the Peso — did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>
<p>But Flaherty’s partner in the purchase, Corte Madera resident Max Perry, said “the Peso will remain the Peso” — an unpretentious dive bar in one of Marin County’s wealthiest areas.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to support your local dive, and there are not a lot of them left,” Perry said in a Feb. 9 interview. “So, just want to make sure that we can be good stewards in protecting a legacy hospitality asset and ensure that it lives on for decades to come.”</p>
<p>The purchase marks Flaherty’s second major acquisition of a historic Marin watering hole. He and a group of investors that includes Perry purchased Sam’s, the landmark dockside restaurant on Tiburon’s Main Street, from longtime owners Steve Sears and Brian Wilson nearly eight years ago as Sam’s Main Street LLC.</p>
<p>The Silver Peso, located at 450 Magnolia Ave., has been closed since May when a car crashed into the back of the two-story building, causing structural damage. A note posted on the bar’s door indicates a local Larkspur family purchased the building and is working with the bar, the city and a construction team to make necessary repairs and reopen safely.</p>
<p>Perry said he and Flaherty hope to reopen the Peso by St. Patrick’s Day, March 17, a target date he called “fluid at this time.”</p>
<p>However, most of the structural renovations are complete, Perry said, and transferring the liquor license is the final major hurdle. New building owners Tommy and Shannon Lamanna have “put in a lot of their coin into the renovation itself and are investing in the business,” Perry said, including adding new flooring and plans to improve the bar’s bathrooms.</p>
<p>New beer taps and a new point-of-sale system are also planned, “but that’s pretty much the extent of the renovations,”...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon police arrest suspect in overnight garage burglary</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-police-arrest-suspect-in-overnight-garage-burglary</link>
     <description>The S.F. man pleaded not guilty to felony and misdemeanor charges.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A San Francisco man pleaded not guilty Feb. 6 to charges stemming from an overnight garage burglary in Tiburon, including one felony count of second-degree burglary, two misdemeanor counts and two sentence enhancements based on prior felony convictions.</p>
<p>Martin Hernandez Gutierrez, 33, was arrested shortly after midnight Feb. 4 after Tiburon police say he broke into a garage on Lagoon View Drive and stole a high-end e-bike worth $10,000. Police also suspect him in a theft from an unlocked vehicle nearby.</p>
<p>Gutierrez was booked into Marin County Jail that morning on $50,000 bail and remained in custody at The Ark’s press time; a pre-trial release hearing is set for Feb. 10.</p>
<p>The Marin District Attorney’s Office filed charges Feb. 5, including the burglary felony, misdemeanor counts of receiving or possessing stolen property and possession of a controlled substance, and two special allegations for prior serious or violent felony convictions under California’s three-strikes law.</p>
<p>The incident began about 12:30 a.m. when Tiburon police responded to Lagoon View Drive for someone breaking into a garage, according to the Tiburon Police Department.</p>
<p>The homeowner told officers a man had entered his garage and taken an e-bike worth about $10,000, then ran away. The homeowner chased him, and the man abandoned the bike roughly 50 yards away before continuing to run. The homeowner recovered the bike and gave officers a detailed description.</p>
<p>Detective Sgt. Rob Law said the homeowner received an alert from his security camera.</p>
<p>“When he checked the notification, he discovered that somebody was walking up his driveway and into the garage,” Law said.</p>
<p>With help from the Sheriff’s Office, Mill Valley Police Department and Belvedere Police Department, officers cordoned off the area and searched for the suspect. They found scattered coins, a white hat and two vehicles that appeared to have been broken into.</p>
<p>Just before 2 a.m., Tiburon officers saw a vehicle parked on Ridge Road and stopped the driver, who gave conflicting statements, police said. His clothing matched the description the homeowner had provided and what appeared on the surveillance video. Officers identified him at the scene as Gutierrez and arrested him.</p>
<p>Police found suspected methamphetamine, several coins, eight stolen credit cards belonging to a Vistazo East Street resident and other evidence believed tied to nearby vehicle thefts in Gutierre...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Appeals court sides with Tiburon in Paradise Drive housing-element lawsuit</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/appeals-court-sides-with-tiburon-in-paradise-drive-housing-element-lawsuit</link>
     <description>California appeals court cleared Tiburon to keep a Paradise Drive site in its housing plan, rejecting neighbors’ CEQA challenge.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon won a significant legal victory last week when a California appellate court overturned a ruling that blocked the town from including a key Paradise Drive parcel in its state-mandated housing plan.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the 1st District Court of Appeal ruled Feb. 2 that Marin Superior Court Judge Sheila Shah Lichtblau erred in September 2024 when she sided with the neighborhood group the Committee for Tiburon. The group had sued the town in June 2023 over the inclusion of the 4576 Paradise Drive in Tiburon’s 2023-2031 housing element.</p>
<p>The neighbors argued the town violated the California Environmental Quality Act by not conducting detailed environmental analysis of the 9.6-acre site. The town’s housing element listed the property as one of 17 sites for potential development, saying it could reasonably accommodate 93 units and hold up to 118 units.</p>
<p>The appellate court’s 30-page opinion establishes a key precedent: “when a housing project has not even been proposed, the lack of project-specific details precludes an informed review of environmental impacts and mitigation measures” — and deferring such a review is “appropriate,” Justice Carin T. Fujisaki wrote. Presiding Justice Alison M. Tucher and Associate Justice Ioana Petrou concurred.</p>
<p>“We are happy that the court of appeal reversed the erroneous trial court ruling and upheld the town’s general plan (environmental-impact report),” Tiburon Town Attorney Ben Stock said in a Feb. 2 email. The Town Council authorized the appeal in November 2024.</p>
<p>The California attorney general, the state Housing and Community Development Department and the California League of Cities all filed amicus briefs supporting Tiburon’s appeal.</p>
<p>The housing roadmap, part of the town’s general plan, requires Tiburon to identify sites that can accommodate at least 639 new housing units over eight years. It does not require the town to build those units.</p>
<p>Lichtblau’s ruling set aside and decertified portions of an environmental-impact report prepared to rezone the Paradise site and other parts of town for denser development.</p>
<p>The appellate court sent two issues back to the lower court: whether Tiburon’s decision to rezone the Paradise site is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act, and whether the town’s General Plan 2040 is “internally consistent and compatible.”</p>
<p>Eric Crandall, who owns 4576 Paradise Drive as Sierra Pines Group LLC, said Feb. 2 the town...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Strawberry neighbors sue to block senior housing project</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-neighbors-sue-to-block-senior-housing-project</link>
     <description>The lawsuit claims the county wrongly fast-tracked the project under state housing laws designed to bypass the public review process.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fight over a five-story senior-living complex proposed for a Strawberry hillside has moved from Nextdoor posts and online petitions to Marin Superior Court, where neighbors are challenging the county’s approval of the 106-unit facility as an illegal end-run around environmental laws.</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed Jan. 22 by the group Tiburon Ridge Neighbors and resident Scott Arwin claims the county wrongly fast-tracked the Spirit Living Group project under state housing laws designed to bypass the public review process that typically slows development. But the neighbors say the 3.7-acre project site at 100 Thomas Place, off North Knoll Road, doesn’t qualify for that streamlined approval because it provides habitat for 20 special-status species and requires removal of 22 heritage trees.</p>
<p>The legal battle pits neighbors concerned about traffic, emergency access and environmental destruction against developers who say Marin desperately needs senior housing for its rapidly aging population.</p>]]></content:encoded>
