     <title>Belvedere upholds $300,000 fine after fiery hearing on construction delays</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-upholds-300-000-fine-after-fiery-hearing-on-construction-delays</link>
     <description>Belvedere upheld a $300,000 construction time-limit penalty against residents David and Julie Flaherty after a court-ordered rehearing.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belvedere City Council upheld a $300,000construction time-limit penalty against residents David and Julie Flaherty after their attorney accused city staff of making “false and fraudulent” statements and warned the city’s constitutional defense could backfire in the courts.</p>
<p>The council voted 4-0 to deny the appeal by the 339 Golden Gate Ave. homeowners in a four-hour hearing Dec. 3. Councilmember Peter Mark, who chaired the Planning Commission during a 2020 dispute over two unapproved olive trees that became the focal point of the case, has recused himself from related council hearings and was absent.</p>
<p>The decision came six months after Marin Superior Court Judge Andrew E. Sweet ruled the council’s 2022 penalty decision lacked adequate factual findings and ordered a new hearing. Sweet retained jurisdiction, meaning the case will return to his court for review of the excessive-fines claim and other constitutional issues.</p>
<p>The $300,000 penalty — the maximum allowed under city rules — was imposed after the owners exceeded the 18-month construction time limit despite being granted 244 days of relief. The project took more than 4½ years from the November 2017 permit to the March 21, 2022, planning department final sign-off. The maximum penalty was reached Nov. 23, 2020 — nine days before the building department’s final approval and 16 months before the planning department’s final approval.</p>
<p>‘False and fraudulent’</p>
<p>Attorney John O’Connor launched a dramatic attack on city staff’s integrity, demanding the council examine the administrative record.</p>
<p>The disputed paragraph in the staff report stated that after the building department gave final approval of the project Dec. 2, 2020, continued work included “removal of unapproved lighting, planting of trees, bushes and other plants, installation of the irrigation system, placement of ground cover and the completion of hardscape elements such as walkways, patios, railings and other exterior decorative elements.”</p>
<p>“This is false and fraudulent,” O’Connor said. “I did not make that accusation lightly. I’m an officer of the court. I used to be a federal prosecutor. This is false.”</p>
<p>O’Connor argued the specific items listed have no documentation after March 2020, just as the COVID-19 pandemic began and when he said the irrigation system was completed March 20.</p>
<p>He had David Flaherty testify under oath that no work described in that paragraph occurred after March...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Welner returns as Tiburon’s mayor with traffic focus</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/welner-returns-as-tiburon-s-mayor-with-traffic-focus</link>
     <description>Tiburon Councilmember Jon Welner and colleague Isaac Nikfar were elected mayor and vice mayor, respectively, on Dec. 3.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Traffic congestion, park improvements and climate action will take center stage in Tiburon this year as Councilmember Jon Welner begins his second stint as mayor, declaring in his first remarks that “this is the year” to solve the town’s traffic problems.</p>
<p>Welner and colleague Isaac Nikfar were elected mayor and vice mayor, respectively, in separate 4-0 votes at the council’s Dec. 3 meeting. Councilmember Jack Ryan was absent.</p>
<p>Welner joined the council in 2018. He was previously mayor in 2022 and once again assumes the role from Holli Thier, who completed her second turn as mayor.</p>
<p>Thier remains on the council, which she joined in 2017, but is also running in the June primary for state Assembly, seeking to replace San Rafael Democrat Damon Connolly. Connolly is running for state Senate as Mike McGuire, D-Healdsburg, terms out.</p>
<p>Councilmembers typically hold the mayoral and vice-mayoral posts on a yearly basis, rotating among each other every December. Nikfar’s election as vice mayor means he is in line to become mayor in December 2026, his first time assuming the role since joining the council in 2023.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere panel backs $1.38-mil plan to fund seawall, police upgrades, Strip cleanup</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-panel-backs-1-38-mil-plan-to-fund-seawall-police-upgrades-strip-cleanup</link>
     <description>The surplus would shore up the crumbling Beach Road seawall, upgrade police facilities and cleaning up the shoreline under state orders.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere’s Finance Committee says the city should direct a $1.38 million budget surplus toward shoring up the crumbling Beach Road seawall, upgrading police facilities and the state-ordered cleanup of a historic shoreline parcel — capping a fiscal year in which revenues exceeded projections by $1.76 million.</p>
<p>The 3-0 Dec. 2 vote sends the recommendation to the City Council for approval at its Jan. 12 meeting. Committee members Patrick Feder and John Wilton were absent.</p>
<p>The funds represent one-time expenditures tied to the city’s unexpectedly strong performance in fiscal 2024-2025, which ended June 30. According to a report by administrative services director Helga Cotter, general fund revenues reached $10.98 million while expenditures came in $616,000 under budget.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lots were gifted by the Belvedere Land Co. in 1896, and all private structures except wharves, boathouses or bathhouses are prohibited. The state has ordered the cleanup of a fallen retaining wall from the property at 228 Beach Road. (Kevin Hessel graphic / The Ark; Apple Maps)</media:description>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Haley Dahm spent 70 nights sleeping under the stars, earned 33 merit badges and rallied 45 volunteers to rebuild her school’s neglected garden, all to join an exclusive group: the first 8,000 girls nationwide to earn the rank of Eagle Scout.</p>
<p>The part-time Tiburon resident achieved the honor in May, becoming part of a historic wave of young women reaching Scouting America’s highest rank since the organization opened to girls in 2019. In that same six-year span, some 300,000 scouts total have earned Eagle — a rank held for life.</p>
<p>Haley compressed her journey into just three years, completing more than 50 hours of community service along the way.</p>

     <title>Former Reed district teacher Jim Allen was known for his unwavering support of students</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/former-reed-district-teacher-jim-allen-was-known-for-his-unwavering-support-of-students</link>
     <description>Jim Allen died Nov. 21 of natural causes at his home in Kentfield. He was 91.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jim Allen, a beloved former Reed Union School District educator who taught generations of local students in his 30 years in the classroom, died Nov. 21 of natural causes at his home in Kentfield. He was 91.</p>
<p>Allen taught at Reed Elementary School, Del Mar Middle School and the former Reedland Woods Middle School for roughly a quarter century, from about 1964 to 1990. Reedland Woods was located at what is now Congregation Kol Shofar.</p>
<p>After retiring from teaching, Allen volunteered as a docent at Angel Island State Park and at the Marin Civic Center. He became a sought-after guide leading tours for schoolchildren of the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed building.</p>
<p>“He got energy from it, and the kids got energy from him,” said Joan Brown, Allen’s long-term partner who formerly served as the head of the Civic Center volunteer program. She called his presenting style “very combustible.”</p>
<p>“I remember so distinctly he was the first one who ever said to me the sentence, ‘You are a writer,’” said New York Times bestselling author Jasmin Darznik, who grew up in Tiburon and was one of Allen’s students. “And you know, that’s a pretty tremendous thing to hear at any age, I think, but especially when you’re in middle school and you’re just beginning to find who you are. It was a wonderful moment that I’ve never forgotten.”</p>
<p>James Carlton Allen was born May 25, 1934, in Los Angeles to salesperson Charles Carlton Allen and advertising model Genevieve Donahue. Allen — no relation to the local Allen family that owns the Belvedere Land Co. — had one younger brother, Ron, two half-siblings and a stepsibling.</p>
<p>He split his childhood between Beverly Hills and Berkeley and attended San Francisco State University, where he earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in education, said sons Park Allen and Link Allen, both of Tiburon.</p>
<p>Allen moved to Marin not long after graduating and began his career as a teacher in Vallejo about 1959 before joining the Reed Union School District about 1964. He retired about 1990, after Link Allen finished at Del Mar, Link said.</p>
<p>About the same time, he started teaching at Reed Union schools, Allen moved to Belvedere. He lived primarily on Bella Vista Avenue and later on the Belvedere Lagoon. He left Belvedere about 2010 following his divorce and lived in San Rafael before settling in Kentfield, where he remained until his death.</p>
<p>Park Allen said his father loved connecting with others and helpi...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Tiburon will spend $154,000 to renovate three workforce-housing condos and make improvements at the police station.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will spend $154,000 to renovate three workforce-housing condos and make improvements at the police station, including expanded electric-vehicle charging capacity.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted 4-0 Dec. 3, with Councilmember Jack Ryan absent, to approve the additional fiscal 2025-2026 spending.</p>
<p>Nearly half of the budget amendment, $75,000, will go toward renovating town-owned condominiums at the Point Tiburon Marsh complex. The remaining $79,000 will go toward the police station. The building needs $54,000 in electrical upgrades to charge a fourth electric vehicle after the town replaces one of the department’s existing gas vehicles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Chalkboard: Del Mar student raises $4,200 for Thanksgiving turkey giveaway</title>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Del Mar Middle School eighth grader Tala Sarhangi raised $4,200 in just three days for Tiburon-based Big God Ministries’ annual Thanksgiving turkey giveaway.</p>
<p>The 13-year-old Tiburon resident says she was inspired after learning about recent disruptions to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food benefits to low-income families, in her history class earlier this fall.</p>
<p>The program, known as SNAP, was in limbo during the 43-day U.S. federal-government shutdown from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12. Officials at the time announced SNAP payments scheduled for Nov. 1 wouldn’t be dispersed to recipients because of the shutdown, though payments had resumed by mid-November.</p>
<p>“I kind of realized I’m very lucky to live in such a nice town where, you know, needing money for food is not as big of an issue,” she says. “I really wanted to give back to our community and help as much as I can.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A former CEO reflects on a career of ‘fixing broken corporations’</title>

     <description>The part-time Tiburon resident retired roughly two decades ago after building a reputation as a corporate “cleaner.”</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maury Myers spent decades rushing into corporate disasters. Now, at 85, his biggest daily challenge is keeping up with Freddy, his 15-year-old miniature labradoodle, during walks through Shoreline Park near downtown Tiburon.</p>
<p>“He forces me to get out and walk him and get some exercise — and he’s very smart,” Myers says Dec. 2. “So he’s a lot of fun to deal with.”</p>
<p>The part-time Tiburon resident, who splits his year between four months here and eight in Honolulu, retired roughly two decades ago after building a reputation as a corporate “cleaner.”</p>
<p>“I got into the business of fixing broken corporations,” Myers says.</p>
<p>His final turnaround came at Waste Management Inc., where he served as chairman and CEO from November 1999 to 2005. He was the company’s sixth CEO in three years, hired to rescue a firm reporting $250 million in missed financial projections, hemorrhaging stock value and facing class-action lawsuits over insider-trading allegations. The company settled those lawsuits in 2001 for $457 million.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>James Carlton Allen</title>

     <description>James Carlton Allen: May 25, 1934 ­­— November 21, 2025</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May 25, 1934 ­­— November 21, 2025</p>
<p>James “Jim” Allen was born in Los Angeles on May 25, 1934. From an early age, Jim had an irrepressible optimism and a gift for connecting with people — a gift he carried throughout his life and career.</p>
<p>After earning his degree and teaching credential from San Francisco State University, Jim began what would become a remarkable thirty-year career as a middle school teacher. Beloved by literally generations of students, Jim was often remembered as their favorite teacher — the one who saw their potential, cheered them on, and made learning feel like discovery. He is often remembered for his annual “day in the life of” project, which had Del Mar Middle Schoolers dress in costume for the historical figure on whom they were reporting to the class.</p>
<p>Jim had a bit of a mischievous side as well — one example was he led a group of kids on a bike parade down Tiburon Boulevard. We can neither confirm nor deny that the police chief was less than thrilled about the traffic that ensued, but it turned out to be a critical factor when the town decided to build the now-famous Tiburon bike path. A fun event that turned into a very positive outcome for all.</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom, Jim’s energy and kindness rippled through the community. He volunteered countless hours as a docent at both the Marin County Civic Center and at Angel Island State Park, sharing his love of history, architecture, and storytelling with visitors from all over the world. Teachers would request Jumpin’ Jim every year when they’d bring their students on tour.</p>
<p>Jim was also a lifelong sports enthusiast — rooting passionately for the Hollywood Stars baseball of his youth, and later for his beloved 49ers, Giants, and Warriors with his sons. Win or lose, he was an eternal optimist — always quick with a smile, a story, and a reminder to keep the faith.</p>
<p>Whether you knew him as Captain Zoom Zoom (his ski instructor nickname), Jumpin’ Jim, Papa, Dimmy, or simply Mr. Allen, you will remember him as a tremendous storyteller, a mentor to many, and one of the kindest souls you could hope to meet. Thoughtful, patient, and endlessly curious, he had a way of making everyone feel important.</p>
<p>Jim’s loving family was the center of his life. He is survived by his life partner, Joan Brown; his sons Park (Christina), Link (Tamara), and Sean; his grandchildren Makenzie, Delaney, Augustine, and Archie; his brothers, Ron (wife Dorothy, and family ...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>The review of every city-owned road, drain, building and retaining wall will forecast what repairs will be needed and what they will cost.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere is undertaking a comprehensive review of every city-owned road, drain, building and retaining wall to create a 20-year forecast of what repairs will be needed and what they will cost.</p>
<p>Two companies have been hired at a total cost of $91,508 to assess facilities and storm drains, while a third is negotiating to assess retaining walls.</p>
<p>City Manager Robert Zadnik announced the plan at the Nov. 10 City Council meeting, saying the effort will help the city manage aging infrastructure before problems become costly emergencies.</p>
<p>The assessments will cover virtually every piece of city-owned infrastructure, from City Hall, which also houses the Community Center and Police Department, to parks including Community Park, Tom Price Park, Centennial Park and Land Co. Park. The city also owns the Public Works Yard, about 30 official and unofficial walking lanes on Belvedere and Corinthian islands, the San Rafael Avenue walking path, visual easements along West Shore Road and all roads and median strips.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Grant helps launch senior-support ‘village’ test at Strawberry complex</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/grant-helps-launch-senior-support-village-test-at-strawberry-complex</link>
     <description>Marin Villages will launch a pilot program at Kruger Pines, where 56 low-income and disabled seniors live in federally subsidized units.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A nonprofit that matches older volunteers with seniors who need help with daily tasks has won $22,500 to test whether its peer-support model can work in affordable housing.</p>
<p>Marin Villages will launch a pilot program in early 2026 at Kruger Pines in Strawberry, where 56 low-income and disabled seniors live in federally subsidized units on North Knoll Road. The Marin Housing Authority, which runs the facility, approached Marin Villages earlier this year.</p>
<p>“They wanted to hear more about our model because they wondered if the same kind of self-help model might work in a public-housing setting,” said John Power, executive director of Marin Villages.</p>
<p>The organization was among 94 groups awarded grants through Marin County’s 2026 Community Grants & Investment Program. Another local recipient, Painted Bins, received $14,000 to produce an environmental education video. The organization, led by Belvedere’s Kathy Huber and associated with Sustainable Marin, places student-art-decorated compost bins in public spaces to promote composting and climate-change awareness.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Legendary ice skater ‘Mr. Debonair’ reflects on career, life at 90</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/legendary-ice-skater-mr-debonair-reflects-on-career-life-at-90</link>
     <description>Hall-of-fame ice skater ‘Mr. Debonair’ Richard Dwyer, a part-time Tiburon resident, turned 90 on Nov. 18.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For over 60 years, Richard Dwyer donned a tuxedo and top hat, skated onto the ice accompanied by a line of performers known as “The Dwyer Girls” and handed roses to audience members in arenas around the world.</p>
<p>The act made him a legend. Olympic champions grew up with his poster on their walls. A president and a governor honored him. Charles M. Schulz name-dropped him in “Peanuts” — twice. He was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Now 90, the part-time Tiburon resident known as “Mr. Debonair” still laces up his skates several times a week, gliding forward and backward with practiced turns for a half-hour at a time. He gave up jumps two years ago, but he’s not ready to give up the ice.</p>
<p>Dwyer celebrated his birthday Nov. 18 with a party in town Nov. 23. A birthday video shared with The Ark featured Olympic figure-skating champions Scott Hamilton and Brian Boitano honoring his legacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A server at Petite Left Bank aims to spread holiday cheer</title>

     <description>Tracy Hobie, lead server at Petite Left Bank, spent Nov. 25 transforming the restaurant’s entrance into a winter wonderland.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tracy Hobie winds white tape around a red velvet rope outside Petite Left Bank on Tiburon Boulevard, creating a candy-cane-like pattern.</p>
<p>Hobie, lead server at the French restaurant, spent Nov. 25 transforming the restaurant’s entrance into a winter wonderland, featuring a fresh Douglas fir tree, white lights, a wooden reindeer, snowflakes and bouquets of roses edged with pine. A snowman in a top hat presides over it all.</p>
<p>The display marks the restaurant’s return to a December tradition: offering free hot chocolate to anyone who walks by.</p>
<p>Though the restaurant was closed that day, kids had already stopped to peer through the window.</p>
<p>“I just really want to bring some cheer for the kids — and really adults too, who get into it like me,” says Hobie, 58. “I love this. This is my favorite part of the holidays, the decorations and the lights and the music.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Garden Plot: A DIY compost pile or worm bin can do wonders</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/garden-plot-a-diy-compost-pile-or-worm-bin-can-do-wonders</link>
     <description>If you have a compost pile or a worm bin, you’re well on your way to creating the amazing product some gardeners call black gold.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have a compost pile or a worm bin, you’re well on your way to creating the amazing product some gardeners call black gold — finished compost rich with nutrients.</p>
<p>You can buy a starter worm bin in stores or online. They vary in price from less than $100 to about $1,700. It’s best to start with something inexpensive and work your way up if you feel inclined to upgrade.</p>
<p>Years ago, my husband made a simple bin out of some old unpainted redwood, but I was not a good worm mother and managed to kill the poor things promptly by not keeping it damp enough. You want it damp, not soaking wet. It’s best to check it every day, and if it seems too wet, add some small pieces of cardboard or shredded brown paper bags to soak up some of the moisture.</p>
<p>You should have a way of capturing any excess liquid that accumulates because that excess is very nutritious for your garden or pots. Commercial bins will likely have a drain so you can catch any runoff.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Friendship Kitchen in Tiburon rallies community against hunger</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/friendship-kitchen-in-tiburon-rallies-community-against-hunger</link>
     <description>The packaged meals were delivered to residents at The Hilarita apartment complex on Ned’s Way and Kruger Pines in Strawberry.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The clatter of knives on cutting boards mixed with laughter and music Nov. 23 as more than 30 volunteers transformed The Ranch’s Dairy Knoll recreation center into a community kitchen, chopping vegetables and rolling meatballs to package 100 meals for local low-income seniors and others in need.</p>
<p>The effort, dubbed The Friendship Kitchen, was organized by Chabad of Tiburon. The packaged meals — meatballs, sauteed veggies and rice — were delivered to residents at The Hilarita apartment complex on Ned’s Way and Kruger Pines in Strawberry, said Mirel Mintz of Chabad of Tiburon, who headed the event with her husband, Rabbi Levi Mintz.</p>
<p>The Friendship Kitchen extends Chabad of Tiburon’s Friendship Circle project, which pairs teens with children who have special needs.</p>
<p>Chabad of Tiburon organized the volunteer day after Levi Mintz said he learned some seniors could not cook meals or “be able to necessarily take care of themselves.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon bike lanes pushed to 2029 as Caltrans proceeds along rest of corridor</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-bike-lanes-pushed-to-2029-as-caltrans-proceeds-along-rest-of-corridor</link>
     <description>The Phase 1 start date hinges on Tiburon first completing a separate project to install underground conduit for fiber-optic cables along the boulevard.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caltrans has confirmed it will pursue Tiburon Boulevard bike lanes within town limits in a second phase of improvements — with funding to be secured next year and construction targeted for early 2029 — as the final design is now complete for its 4.6-mile Mill Valley-to-Tiburon pavement project set to start next summer.</p>
<p>The Phase 1 start date hinges on Tiburon first completing a separate project to install underground conduit for fiber-optic cables along the boulevard, agency spokesperson Matt O’Donnell said. The town took on the work after Caltrans considered adding it to the maintenance project but ultimately deferred.</p>
<p>The Caltrans improvements along state-owned Highway 131, which doubles as East Blithedale Avenue in Mill Valley and as Tiburon Boulevard east of the southbound Highway 101 on-ramp, are expected to take a year, wrapping in summer 2027. They include repaving, drainage upgrades, guardrails, curb ramps, signs, traffic signals, lighting, crosswalks and intersection improvements. The California Transportation Commission in October allocated $18.57 million toward the work, though Matt O’Donnell said construction costs would be closer to $15.2 million.</p>
<p>Phase 2 would include a stakeholder task force “to provide inclusive community input and develop an endorsed scope and configuration for bikeway and transit improvements,” O’Donnell said.</p>
<p>Caltrans, the county and Southern Marin Supervisor Stephanie Moulton-Peters are coordinating to select a task-force facilitator, O’Donnell said, as the agency looks to “finalize task-force membership and convene the group in early 2026.”</p>
<p>New lanes coming to Mill Valley, unincorporated areas</p>
<p>Caltrans will, however, proceed with creating new Class 2 bike lanes on both sides of the road in Mill Valley, Strawberry and unincorporated Tiburon, starting from Mill Valley’s Tower Road-East Blithedale intersection. The lanes will run along the Highway 101 overpass, becoming Class 4 protected bikeways on Tiburon Boulevard at South Knoll Road and North Knoll Road before ending at Blackfield Drive.</p>
<p>On the south side, a temporary Class 1 multiuse path — with a permanent path to follow in Phase 2 — will be created between Strawberry and Blackfield drives. That path leads to the existing Class 3 bike route along Greenwood Cove Drive and Greenwood Beach Road, where residents have long complained about bike traffic and have sought to redirect faster cyclists out to Tiburon Boulevard...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon muralist turns Corte Madera underpass into art</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-muralist-turns-corte-madera-underpass-into-art</link>
     <description>“The Sky Whales” features three whales painted in light blues and pinks swimming, or flying, through a pink sky with a full moon alongside pelicans and egrets.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Rachel Hébert, raising kids in Marin meant being a frequent shopper at the Trader Joe’s in Greenbrae. Getting there meant driving through the Wornum Drive underpass at Highway 101. Each trip, she’d eye the massive gray wall.</p>
<p>“I just had this idea that that big, blank gray wall should be something else,” she said.</p>
<p>So the Tiburon resident, a professional muralist and artist, took matters into her own hands and last month completed a 100-foot-long, 11-foot-tall mural spanning the southern length of the underpass.</p>
<p>“The Sky Whales” features three whales painted in light blues and pinks swimming, or flying, through a pink sky with a full moon alongside pelicans and egrets.</p>
<p>The mural took about a month to paint, but it followed a three-year process that involved getting approvals from Caltrans, which owns the wall that is also load-bearing for the highway that travels over it.</p>]]></content:encoded>
