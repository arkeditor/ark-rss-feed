     <title>Public comment opens on Strawberry seminary development environmental report</title>

     <description>Three significant impacts that cannot be fully mitigated: vehicle miles traveled, greenhouse-gas emissions and construction noise.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marin County has releasedthe final environmental impactreport for a large-scale redevelopment of the former Golden Gate Baptist Seminary property in Strawberry, kicking off a 45-day public comment period that ends Jan. 26.</p>
<p>The 127-acre project at 201 Seminary Drive would transform the site into a mixed-use development with 336 single- and multifamily residential units — including 70 affordable units — and a 150-unit senior residential-care facility. The project also includes a 17,000-square-foot fitness center and a 3,000-square-foot preschool, both open to the public. While more than 70% of the campus would remain as open space, athletic fields, paths and plazas, the project would add about 530 new residents and about 250 new workers.</p>
<p>Developer North Coast Land Holdings LLC also proposes maintaining the academic campus for up to 1,000 students under an existing 1953 conditional use permit.</p>
<p>The 684-page environmental review, released Dec. 12, identifies three significant impacts that cannot be fully mitigated: vehicle miles traveled, greenhouse-gas emissions and construction noise.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Review cites gaps in 106-unit Strawberry senior-care plan as clock ticks</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/review-cites-gaps-in-106-unit-strawberry-senior-care-plan-as-clock-ticks</link>
     <description>Inconsistencies must be resolved by early January, though developers say the setback is routine and will not derail the project.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A proposed 106-unit senior-care facility on Strawberry’s North Knoll Road faces code inconsistencies that must be resolved by early January, though developers say the setback is routine and will not derail the project.</p>
<p>The Marin Community Development Agency completed a required 30-day consistency analysis and, as of Dec. 6, found the 70 N. Knoll Road project inconsistent with multiple development standards. Senior Planner Megan Alton confirmed the analysis was sent to the developers, San Anselmo-based Spirit Living Group, who must address the inconsistencies or apply for waivers by Jan. 4.</p>
<p>The county must issue a decision by that date approving or denying the project in its entirety. Because the proposal is undergoing ministerial review, the decision is not appealable. A denial would require the developers to revise and resubmit their application, while an approval would allow Spirit Living to apply for building permits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon to explore Bramble Beach for kayak launch</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-to-explore-bramble-beach-for-kayak-launch</link>
     <description>While Bramble Beach is being evaluated for the first time, the launch has been a longtime desire of residents and officials.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a decade of false starts, Tiburon is taking another run at creating a stand-up paddleboard and kayak launch on Richardson Bay — this time at a small beach near the Belvedere border that town officials say will be difficult to pull off.</p>
<p>The Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission voted 4-0 Dec. 8 to have town staff explore options for a launch at Bramble Beach, located just off San Rafael Avenue and Tiburon Boulevard. Commissioner Liz Judge was absent.</p>
<p>While Bramble Beach is being evaluated for the first time, the launch has been a longtime desire of residents and officials. The Town Council first explored placing one along Shoreline Park in downtown Tiburon in 2015, but the idea fizzled when officials determined there were limited options for safe entry because of tidal action and ferry traffic.</p>
<p>In a 2023 survey for the town’s parks master plan, 39% of respondents wanted a kayak and paddleboard launch — the sixth-highest priority — and when asked where to invest resources, a launch site ranked No. 1. In 2015, the estimated construction cost was $125,000. Current values would increase construction by 30%-40%, not including contingencies, putting the cost at roughly $162,500 to $175,000.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>The Tiburon Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission will explore whether it can place a paddlecraft launch site at Bramble Beach, which borders Belvedere at San Rafael Avenue off Tiburon Boulevard, as seen Dec. 10. Officials have acknowledged various factors that could make this site difficult to pursue, primarily a lack of parking. (Francisco Martinez / The Ark)</media:description>

     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-submits-fifth-draft-housing-element-to-state-for-final-approval</link>
     <description>The element, which was due Jan. 31, 2023, establishes a roadmap for accommodating at least 160 housing units required under state law.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere submitted its long-awaited housing element to Sacramento on Dec. 11, marking a potential end to nearly three years of noncompliance with state housing mandates.</p>
<p>Planning Director Rebecca Markwick said the city sent both clean and redlined versions of the fifth draft to the California Department of Housing and Community Development, which has 60 days to issue a final determination. The element, which was due Jan. 31, 2023, establishes a roadmap for accommodating at least 160 housing units required under state law.</p>
<p>The submission follows a Nov. 10 City Council vote to adopt the state-mandated 2023-2031 housing element and approve zoning amendments enabling new development under the eight-year plan. The council formally adopted the zoning changes in a required second vote Dec. 8.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere hires officer, filling fifth position in long-understaffed force</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-hires-officer-filling-fifth-position-in-long-understaffed-force</link>
     <description>Tyler Preston, a patrol officer since 2023 with the Mill Valley Police Department, will start Jan. 4.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belvedere Police Department has hired a new officer after months of four-officer staffing left patrol working 12-hour shifts and overtime.</p>
<p>Tyler Preston, a patrol officer since 2023 with the Mill Valley Police Department, will start as Belvedere’s newest police officer Jan. 4, Chief Jason Wu announced in a statement. Hiring Preston at $104,484 annually brings the department to five patrol officers, what officials call “manageable” and one below “ideal.”</p>
<p>The opening came after Sgt. Tom Sabido announced his retirement effective in September, freeing a position tied up by his medical leave.</p>
<p>Operating with only four officers forced the department to rely on long shifts, schedule adjustments and part-time officers to maintain 24-hour coverage, with support from the Tiburon Police Department during extended absences.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon ferry riders will gain improved service flexibility under a $118 million fleet modernization program approved by Golden Gate Ferry’s board.</p>
<p>The district awarded a $92.4 million contract to Mavrik Marine Inc., a Washington-state shipbuilder, to construct two new vessels that will launch an eight-year replacement effort.</p>
<p>Currently, only half of the agency’s four high-speed catamarans can dock at Tiburon and Sausalito because of design differences among the boats. The new standardized fleet will eliminate that constraint, allowing any vessel to serve any route.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After months of negotiations, the Belvedere-Tiburon Landmarks Society and neighboring residents reached a compromise on how many amplified-music events can be held at the Art & Garden Center, ending uncertainty that had prevented the nonprofit from booking any weddings in 2026.</p>
<p>The agreement limits Landmarks to 16 total events annually between March and November — 14 of them with amplified noise. The remaining two can have unamplified instrumental music for a maximum of 60 guests. Maximum noise from amplified events is limited to 60 decibels at the property line, with amplified music ending at 8:30 p.m., guests off-site by 9 p.m. and vendors and Landmarks staff off no later than 10 p.m.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Steve McNamara was part-owner of The Ark, longtime owner of Pacific Sun</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/steve-mcnamara-was-part-owner-of-the-ark-longtime-owner-of-pacific-sun</link>
     <description>Steve McNamara died of natural causes Nov. 24 at his home in Mill Valley. He was 91.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Steve McNamara, a Marin journalism mainstay who once owned a minority stake in The Ark and also owned and published the Pacific Sun alternative weekly, died of natural causes Nov. 24 at his home in Mill Valley. He was 91.</p>
<p>McNamara joined The Ark’s ownership team in 1987 as a minority partner alongside former Ark owners Marilyn Kessler and Barbara Gnoss. The three purchased the newspaper from Tiburon resident James McClatchy, a principal in the McClatchy newspaper group, as the family looked to divest from its local offerings to focus on larger, metropolitan publications.</p>
<p>Belvedere resident George Gnoss, who was married to Barbara until her death in 2009, said McNamara was “always a really upbeat and creative person” who proved to be “a helpful partner at the outset” of Kessler and Gnoss’ tenure as owners.</p>
<p>“At the time, Steve really gave them ‘brave pills’ to tell them they could make this work,” George Gnoss said Dec. 9.</p>
<p>The Ark printed at McNamara’s Mill Valley facility, Marin Sun Printing, where the Pacific Sun also printed. McNamara owned 20% of The Ark and sold his stake to Gnoss and Kessler in 1999. George Gnoss sold his and Barbara’s stake in 2010, while Kessler sold her share in 2011.</p>
<p>McNamara earned greater recognition in Marin as the Pacific Sun’s publisher and owner across a 38-year tenure from 1966 to 2004, when he sold the newspaper to Embarcadero Media; it’s now owned by Weeklys, publisher of the North Bay Bohemian, East Bay Express and others.</p>
<p>Ten months after McNamara assumed ownership of Pacific Sun, the newspaper won a first-place award from the San Francisco Press Club, the Princeton Alumni Weekly wrote in 2017, adding that “McNamara turned the paper around by emphasizing good writing.”</p>
<p>Pacific Sun published the first passages of author Armistead Maupin’s “Tales of The City,” then known as “The Serial.” Future U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, also worked as a reporter for Pacific Sun in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>McNamara founded and served as the first president of the National Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, now known as AAN Publishers. He taught at San Francisco State University and, after selling the Pacific Sun, advised incarcerated journalists at the San Quentin Rehabilitation Center on producing the San Quentin News.</p>
<p>Stephen McNamara was born July 9, 1934, in Chicago to Susan Deul and book publisher R.C. McNamara Jr., the couple’s only child. He grew up in Urban...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Painter, appraiser and teacher Helen Werngren creates her art at Sausalito’s Industrial Center Building.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artist Helen Werngren says the idea for each of her paintings comes from a raw feeling. All of her emotions splash onto the canvas, creating what she calls “chaos.”</p>
<p>The result is a maelstrom of color — but then her precise brush strokes come in, she says, as she fills large swaths of the canvas with pure white, leaving only small gems of color.</p>
<p>“I’m literally whitening out the chaos in my life and saving the gems,” she says Dec. 12.</p>
<p>Werngren creates her work at Sausalito’s Industrial Center Building. The 30-year veteran painter, appraiser and teacher lives on Beach Road and walks her dog, Albert — named after Albert Einstein and sporting similarly wispy white hair — at Blackie’s Pasture most mornings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/wilkinson-returns-as-belvedere-mayor-with-beach-road-fire-service-priorities</link>
     <description>The Belvedere City Council voted unanimously Dec. 8 to make Councilmember Sally Wilkinson mayor and colleague Kevin Burke vice mayor.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere has a familiar face atop its City Council as Sally Wilkinson returns to the mayor’s office for a second time, citing the Beach Road stabilization project, a costly fire-services contract and the city’s 20-year vision plan as top priorities heading into 2026.</p>
<p>The council voted unanimously Dec. 8 to make Wilkinson mayor and Kevin Burke vice mayor, consistent with the city’s policy of rotating the top positions annually. Wilkinson previously served as mayor in 2022, while Burke steps into his first term as vice mayor.</p>
<p>Wilkinson takes over from Jane Cooper, who served as mayor for the past year and remains on the council.</p>
<p>With the city’s council-manager system, City Manager Robert Zadnik oversees daily operations and city staff while elected officials set policy direction.</p>
<p>Wilkinson served as vice mayor in 2024, during which the council tackled issues ranging from housing to police to coyotes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Garden Plot: Find unique gifts for gardeners at local shops, nurseries</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/garden-plot-find-unique-gifts-for-gardeners-at-local-shops-nurseries</link>
     <description>There are many interesting things out there for the gardener in your life.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve scoured the local plant nurseries for gift ideas. I didn’t see anything earthshakingly new, though there are still many interesting things out there for the gardener in your life.</p>
<p>Winter is a good time to plant citrus trees, and local nurseries have many options. If you don’t already have a Meyer lemon tree, this would be a good time to consider one. They’re grafted onto dwarf root stock, so they stay relatively small. I planted one about 20 years ago. It’s only about 5 feet tall and has a shrub-like profile, so the fruit is very easy to pick without a ladder.</p>
<p>The big advantage to the Meyer lemon is that they are simultaneously producing flowers, tiny green fruits and maturing lemons, so you have ripening fruit all year. Some people prefer the grocery store lemon, typically a Eureka, but those are a much larger tree than the Meyer. If you need a lemon and you have a Meyer tree, chances are you’ll just go out and pick one versus driving to the store.</p>
<p>Ground home and garden store at 1520 Tiburon Blvd. has an interesting selection of garden-themed gift items. They carry Fermob French garden furniture, which comes in many styles and colors; it’s pricey but very durable. They also sell a line of comfy heated outdoor chairs and love seats, which sound pretty good this time of year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere upholds $300,000 fine after fiery hearing on construction delays</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-upholds-300-000-fine-after-fiery-hearing-on-construction-delays</link>
     <description>Belvedere upheld a $300,000 construction time-limit penalty against residents David and Julie Flaherty after a court-ordered rehearing.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belvedere City Council upheld a $300,000construction time-limit penalty against residents David and Julie Flaherty after their attorney accused city staff of making “false and fraudulent” statements and warned the city’s constitutional defense could backfire in the courts.</p>
<p>The council voted 4-0 to deny the appeal by the 339 Golden Gate Ave. homeowners in a four-hour hearing Dec. 3. Councilmember Peter Mark, who chaired the Planning Commission during a 2020 dispute over two unapproved olive trees that became the focal point of the case, has recused himself from related council hearings and was absent.</p>
<p>The decision came six months after Marin Superior Court Judge Andrew E. Sweet ruled the council’s 2022 penalty decision lacked adequate factual findings and ordered a new hearing. Sweet retained jurisdiction, meaning the case will return to his court for review of the excessive-fines claim and other constitutional issues.</p>
<p>The $300,000 penalty — the maximum allowed under city rules — was imposed after the owners exceeded the 18-month construction time limit despite being granted 244 days of relief. The project took more than 4½ years from the November 2017 permit to the March 21, 2022, planning department final sign-off. The maximum penalty was reached Nov. 23, 2020 — nine days before the building department’s final approval and 16 months before the planning department’s final approval.</p>
<p>‘False and fraudulent’</p>
<p>Attorney John O’Connor launched a dramatic attack on city staff’s integrity, demanding the council examine the administrative record.</p>
<p>The disputed paragraph in the staff report stated that after the building department gave final approval of the project Dec. 2, 2020, continued work included “removal of unapproved lighting, planting of trees, bushes and other plants, installation of the irrigation system, placement of ground cover and the completion of hardscape elements such as walkways, patios, railings and other exterior decorative elements.”</p>
<p>“This is false and fraudulent,” O’Connor said. “I did not make that accusation lightly. I’m an officer of the court. I used to be a federal prosecutor. This is false.”</p>
<p>O’Connor argued the specific items listed have no documentation after March 2020, just as the COVID-19 pandemic began and when he said the irrigation system was completed March 20.</p>
<p>He had David Flaherty testify under oath that no work described in that paragraph occurred after March...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Welner returns as Tiburon’s mayor with traffic focus</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/welner-returns-as-tiburon-s-mayor-with-traffic-focus</link>
     <description>Tiburon Councilmember Jon Welner and colleague Isaac Nikfar were elected mayor and vice mayor, respectively, on Dec. 3.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Traffic congestion, park improvements and climate action will take center stage in Tiburon this year as Councilmember Jon Welner begins his second stint as mayor, declaring in his first remarks that “this is the year” to solve the town’s traffic problems.</p>
<p>Welner and colleague Isaac Nikfar were elected mayor and vice mayor, respectively, in separate 4-0 votes at the council’s Dec. 3 meeting. Councilmember Jack Ryan was absent.</p>
<p>Welner joined the council in 2018. He was previously mayor in 2022 and once again assumes the role from Holli Thier, who completed her second turn as mayor.</p>
<p>Thier remains on the council, which she joined in 2017, but is also running in the June primary for state Assembly, seeking to replace San Rafael Democrat Damon Connolly. Connolly is running for state Senate as Mike McGuire, D-Healdsburg, terms out.</p>
<p>Councilmembers typically hold the mayoral and vice-mayoral posts on a yearly basis, rotating among each other every December. Nikfar’s election as vice mayor means he is in line to become mayor in December 2026, his first time assuming the role since joining the council in 2023.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere panel backs $1.38-mil plan to fund seawall, police upgrades, Strip cleanup</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-panel-backs-1-38-mil-plan-to-fund-seawall-police-upgrades-strip-cleanup</link>
     <description>The surplus would shore up the crumbling Beach Road seawall, upgrade police facilities and cleaning up the shoreline under state orders.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere’s Finance Committee says the city should direct a $1.38 million budget surplus toward shoring up the crumbling Beach Road seawall, upgrading police facilities and the state-ordered cleanup of a historic shoreline parcel — capping a fiscal year in which revenues exceeded projections by $1.76 million.</p>
<p>The 3-0 Dec. 2 vote sends the recommendation to the City Council for approval at its Jan. 12 meeting. Committee members Patrick Feder and John Wilton were absent.</p>
<p>The funds represent one-time expenditures tied to the city’s unexpectedly strong performance in fiscal 2024-2025, which ended June 30. According to a report by administrative services director Helga Cotter, general fund revenues reached $10.98 million while expenditures came in $616,000 under budget.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>Belvedere owns a series of open-space parcels along Belvedere Cove collectively known as The Strip, spanning from Lower Woodland Lane public stairs just behind the San Francisco Yacht Club parking lot (bottom left) to 340 Beach Road. The lots were gifted by the Belvedere Land Co. in 1896, and all private structures except wharves, boathouses or bathhouses are prohibited. The state has ordered the cleanup of a fallen retaining wall from the property at 228 Beach Road. (Kevin Hessel graphic / The Ark; Apple Maps)</media:description>

     <description>Haley compressed her journey into just three years, completing more than 50 hours of community service along the way.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Haley Dahm spent 70 nights sleeping under the stars, earned 33 merit badges and rallied 45 volunteers to rebuild her school’s neglected garden, all to join an exclusive group: the first 8,000 girls nationwide to earn the rank of Eagle Scout.</p>
<p>The part-time Tiburon resident achieved the honor in May, becoming part of a historic wave of young women reaching Scouting America’s highest rank since the organization opened to girls in 2019. In that same six-year span, some 300,000 scouts total have earned Eagle — a rank held for life.</p>
<p>Haley compressed her journey into just three years, completing more than 50 hours of community service along the way.</p>
<p>Her achievements culminated in an ambitious service project at Pathways Charter School in Rohnert Park, where she transformed a trash-strewn, rotting garden into a thriving community space.</p>]]></content:encoded>
