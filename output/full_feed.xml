     <title>Reed district warned to rein in deficit spending</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-district-warned-to-rein-in-deficit-spending</link>
     <description>Unless the district cuts $1.75 million over two years, its reserves will fall short of the required 27% minimum by fiscal year 2027-2028.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Marin County Office of Education has warned the Reed Union School District about its “unsustainable” deficit spending, noting that unless the district cuts about $1.75 million from its budget in the next two years, it will fall short of its reserve goals by fiscal 2027-2028.</p>
<p>The warning was issued in a Sept. 15 letter approving the district’s current-year $33.2-million budget and its accompanying projections two years out; the county Office of Education is required to review the budget annually under the state education code to ensure it meets state standards for fiscal solvency and aligns with the district’s Local Control Accountability Plan.</p>
<p>Though the county has vouched for the district’s ability to meet its financial obligations in the next three years, the letter notes the district’s planned deficit spending will shrink its ending fund balance by 35% in that time as it pulls from its reserves to close the gap. That projection, it notes, is inclusive of a planned $300,000 in salary reductions beginning in the 2026-2027 school year.</p>
<p>If the district continues to deficit spend at the projected rates, the county letter says, its unrestricted general fund balance will fall to about 21.5% of expenditures, or about $7.6 million, by fiscal year 2027-2028 — short of the district policy that requires a minimum reserve of 27% of expenditures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Reed district test scores show gains in English, math</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-district-test-scores-show-gains-in-english-math</link>
     <description>Some 81% of Reed students met English standards and 79% met math standards, significantly outpacing Marin County and statewide averages.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Standardized test scores in the Reed Union School District rose about five percentage points in English and four points in math, with local students once again outperforming their peers across the county and state by significant margins.</p>
<p>Some 81% of Reed district students met or exceeded grade-level standards in English, 79% in math, according to results of the 2024-2025 exam released Oct. 9 by the California Department of Education. That’s up from the 76% of students who met or exceeded English standards and the 75% who met or exceeded math standards on last year’s exam.</p>
<p>The district’s scores remain markedly higher than the average in Marin, where about 62% of students met or exceeded standards in English and 54% in math. Statewide, just 49% of students met or exceeded standards in English, 37% in math.</p>
<p>Reed district Coordinator of Educational Services Nicole Trickett called the increases in both math and language arts “pretty significant,” noting that even when the district does see increases to scores, it doesn’t always see such a large bump.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Strawberry senior facility raises concerns over size, fit</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-senior-facility-raises-concerns-over-size-fit</link>
     <description>The 106-unit facility would include 71 independent-living apartments and 35 assisted-living suites on the 6.6-acre hillside site off North Knoll Road.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A five-story, 150,655-square-foot senior-care facility proposed for a vacant Strawberry hillside off North Knoll Road is advancing through Marin County’s approval process despite vocal opposition from neighbors who say the development doesn’t fit their semi-rural neighborhood.</p>
<p>The developers, brothers Ali Shabahangi and Amir Kia of San Anselmo-based Spirit Living Group, submitted the latest revision to their application Oct. 6, proposing 106 total units, with 71 independent-living apartments and 35 assisted-living and memory-care suites. The building would occupy 3.7 acres of the 6.6-acre site at 70 N. Knoll Road, with the remaining acreage to be preserved as open space.</p>
<p>The county now has until Nov. 6 to deem the application complete or incomplete under the ministerial-review process, or streamlined approval in which local governments must approve projects that meet objective standards without discretionary hearings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon officer placed on leave after DUI, child-endangerment arrest in Petaluma</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-officer-placed-on-leave-after-dui-child-endangerment-arrest-in-petaluma</link>
     <description>An independent investigator will review whether any departmental policies were violated as the district attorney weighs potential charges.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tiburon police officer has been placed on administrative leave after he was arrested Oct. 13 near downtown Petaluma on suspicion of driving under the influence and child endangerment.</p>
<p>The officer, employed by the Tiburon Police Department since June 2019, was off duty when arrested about 4 p.m. and then booked into Sonoma County Jail in Santa Rosa on allegations of child abuse with possible great bodily injury or death — a “wobbler” case that could result in a misdemeanor or felony charge punishable by up to six years in prison and a $10,000 fine if convicted — plus two misdemeanor allegations of drunken driving.</p>
<p>One is for suspicion of impaired driving at any level of intoxication and the other for exceeding a blood-alcohol content of at least 0.08%, California’s legal limit for drivers 21 and older. Drivers convicted of a first-time DUI face an average of $13,500 in fines and penalties as well as a suspended license, according to Tiburon police.</p>
<p>The Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office confirmed it is reviewing the case for the potential charges.</p>
<p>“The Tiburon Police Department will fully cooperate with the ongoing investigation led by the Sonoma County (District Attorney’s) Office,” Chief Michelle Jean said in an Oct. 20 press statement. “In addition, the town is reviewing the circumstances of the arrest and has engaged with an independent investigator to ensure a fair and impartial review of whether any Police Department policies were violated. The Police Department holds its officers to the highest standards of conduct and, pending the results of both the criminal investigation and administrative review, will take appropriate action that reflects the values of the department.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere council reduces Blanding Lane construction fine to $210,000</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-council-reduces-blanding-lane-construction-fine-to-210-000</link>
     <description>The penalty was reduced by $120,000 after the council granted relief for fire training use and water district delays but rejected other claims.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Blanding Lane homeowner will pay a $210,000 penalty for construction delays after the Belvedere City Council granted only partial relief from his original $330,000 fine.</p>
<p>Owner Chris Henry had appealed for a complete waiver of the penalty. At the Oct. 13 City Council meeting, officials agreed to reduce the fine by $120,000 after a two-hour hearing but denied most of his arguments for leniency.</p>
<p>The city’s construction time-limit ordinance allows 18 months to finish a project costing over $500,000, with an optional six-month extension. Henry’s deadline expired April 21, 2024. Penalties accrued daily at $1,200 through the project’s completion April 8, 2025 — 320 days late.</p>
<p>The council voted unanimously to grant 100 days of relief. The reduction covered 10 days Henry allowed Tiburon Fire Protection District to use the property for training exercises and 90 days for delays caused by a Marin Municipal Water District infrastructure leak.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon council OKs commission’s picks for early design of ponds site, mini parks</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-council-oks-commission-s-picks-for-early-design-of-ponds-site-mini-parks</link>
     <description>Two design firms will create conceptual plans for a basketball court, new swings and improvements at the former sanitation ponds site by spring 2026.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will spend $94,600 to create early design concepts for improvements at the former sanitation ponds site and three neighborhood mini parks, including a basketball court and new swings.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously Oct. 15 to approve contracts with two firms for 30% conceptual designs. Mill Valley-based RHAA Landscape Architecture and Planning will design improvements at Belveron Mini Park and the former ponds site near McKegney Green for $49,728. Santa Rosa-based Carlile Macy Inc. will design improvements at Cypress Hollow Park and the Bel Aire play area for $44,870.</p>
<p>The agreements allow the council to review conceptual plans before deciding whether to proceed with full construction documents, Public Works Engineering Manager David Eshoo wrote in a staff report. Funding comes from the town’s fiscal year 2025-2026 capital improvement program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere runner sets world record in 800-meter race at Santa Barbara meet</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-runner-sets-world-record-in-800-meter-race-at-santa-barbara-meet</link>
     <description>Nancy Simmons clocked 2:38.05 at the Santa Barbara meet, beating the previous 2:39.61 record set in 2016 by 1.56 seconds.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere resident Nancy Simmons set a world record in the women’s 65-69 age group 800-meter run Oct. 19 at the Beverley Lewis Memorial Open/Masters Track and Field meet at Westmont College in Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>Simmons clocked 2:38.05, besting the previous world record of 2:39.61 set in 2016 by 1.56 seconds.</p>
<p>The achievement came just five months after Simmons ran her first 800 as part of a relay team that set a world record May 24 in Fairfax, Virginia.</p>
<p>Simmons won the 800-meter race at the USATF Masters Outdoor Championships in Huntsville, Alabama, in July with a time of 2:41.77. After that race, she said she realized she was about 2 seconds off the world record and set a goal to break it.</p>
<p>“I’m going to take some time to rest my body and my brain and then think about what’s next,” she said.</p>
<p>Simmons competes with Impala Racing Team and has been running competitively since 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Three retired 65-year-olds log 13,000 steps during regular walks while catching up on life after decades in different careers.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joan Boyce, Gay Maxey and Patty LaVine have turned Blackie’s Pasture into their regular meeting spot since retiring. The three 65-year-olds walk the path, logging about 13,000 steps while talking about their lives after decades in different careers.</p>
<p>The path sits partway between where each of them lives — Boyce and LaVine in Santa Rosa, Maxey in San Francisco. On Oct. 15, they met for one of their regular walks.</p>
<p>“It’s calm and peaceful and beautiful and safe,” LaVine says. “We love it here.”</p>
<p>LaVine recalls bringing her kids to Tiburon years ago for travel soccer matches and marveling that the field sat right on the water.</p>
<p>“We used to play on that field, and I’m like, ‘How crazy is this?’” she says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Susan Ann Compton Carpenter</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/susan-ann-compton-carpenter</link>
     <description>Susan Ann Compton Carpenter of Tiburon died September 17, 2025.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Susan Ann Compton Carpenter had a peaceful and easy life — full of love, joy and science. She was born in Metropolis, Illinois, on December 23, 1941, to Wava Jennette Lambert and Robert Wilson Compton. Her house in those early years did not have indoor plumbing. Her parents moved early in her life to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, seeking work which proved a turning point for the family. Oak Ridge was a town built to support research and engineering in physics. With that exposure, her family’s expectations dramatically changed.</p>
<p>She went to college and studied physics. During college, she met the man who would become her husband, Joe Carpenter. He was also studying hard sciences. After marriage, she primarily worked to support her husband’s career. Joe went on to get his PhD in Metallurgical Engineering and rise to become a manager in the scientific field. They were married for 60 years.</p>
<p>She lived most of her life in Oak Ridge, TN, and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>She raised two children, Keri and Tim, in Tennessee. Both followed the success of their parents and pursued advanced degrees in computer science and law, respectively.</p>
<p>In 1998, they moved to the Gangplank Marina in Washington, D.C. Joe worked nearby as a scientist until 2010. She started and was the first commodore of the Gangplank Slipholders Association (GPSA) yacht club and has been instrumental in the club both from a social and political advocacy standpoint for over 20 years.</p>
<p>Throughout their entire lives, Susan and Joe also got huge amounts of enjoyment from traveling. The 1970s saw them take yearly car trips across the U.S. with their two young children. In the ’80s, they took a seminal trip to India to visit the family of a colleague of Joe’s from graduate school, Naginder Naidu. The ’90s saw more adventurous travel into Ukraine and multiple trips to Europe as their children studied abroad. They also traveled to China, The Philippines, Japan, Egypt, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and South and Central America.</p>
<p>In 2010, when a marina friend asked if she wanted to go on safari, she answered “Heck yes!” and ventured forth into South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. Many more trips abounded until about 2020, when Susan’s health woes started to keep them mostly stateside. She moved to Tiburon in 2024 to be cared for by her daughter and son-in-law. Her earthly journeys came to a peaceful conclusion on September 17, 2025. She was surrounded with love, family and friends until ...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Garden Plot: Artificial lawns are a tidy solution with some hidden costs</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/garden-plot-artificial-lawns-are-a-tidy-solution-with-some-hidden-costs</link>
     <description>Homeowners praise the tidiness and low maintenance but must weigh environmental concerns, PFAS chemicals, heat retention, and high installation costs.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you thought about replacing your water- and maintenance-nightmare of a lawn with artificial turf? I talked to a few homeowners who have installed synthetic lawns, and people seem very happy with the product and tidiness of their gardens after these installations. A friend told me that it makes her happy just to look out at her backyard “lawn.” Gone are the maintenance, toxic weed killers and huge water bills, along with the two big G’s — grubs and gophers — not to mention moles, which are some of the most vexing pests that can try the patience of those who love their lawns.</p>
<p>The decision to remove a lawn and install artificial turf opens a whole new can of worms. First, you’ll want to do some research about what the turf is made from, as that can range from old tires to plastic bottles. There’s some evidence that these products, made from ground-up plastics, can create runoff that’s not environmentally friendly. Then there’s the dreaded PFAS moniker for the thousands of substances of “forever chemicals” that persist almost indefinitely. Artificial turf can also be hot in warm weather, and upfront installation is costly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon to be first city in nation to ban all tobacco sales without exceptions</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-to-be-first-city-in-nation-to-ban-all-tobacco-sales-without-exceptions</link>
     <description>The new law will take effect Dec. 5 following the Town Council’s unanimous approval Oct. 15 and its expected vote to formally adopt on Nov. 5.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twenty years after Tiburon sparked a nationwide movement to ban trans fats, the town is poised to become the first city in the nation to ban all tobacco sales without exemptions.</p>
<p>The new law will take effect Dec. 5 following the Town Council’s unanimous approval Oct. 15 and its anticipated support in a second, required vote to formally adopt the ordinance, scheduled for Nov. 5.</p>
<p>Beverly Hills and Manhattan Beach enacted tobacco sales bans in 2021, but Beverly Hills allows hotels to sell to guests and Manhattan Beach includes a hardship exemption for businesses. Tiburon’s ordinance contains no such exceptions, though it does not apply to products intended to help people quit smoking.</p>
<p>“You can be proud of the fact that you’ve pushed the envelope even further, and you are truly the first to accomplish this complete ban without any exemptions,” Jeremiah Mock told councilmembers after the vote.</p>
<p>Mock, a University of California at San Francisco professor who researches human tobacco waste as a health anthropologist and garbologist, told the council that “the decisions you’re making are not only with regard to the health of people but also to the environment that you live in and that you’re custodians of as public servants.”</p>
<p>The ban positions Tiburon at the forefront of the Tobacco Endgame Movement, an American Heart Association initiative aimed at ending commercial tobacco and nicotine use. Recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show more than 57% of adults surveyed supported eliminating all tobacco product sales.</p>
<p>Youth advocates cite vaping rates</p>
<p>The Youth Advocacy Committee, a group of Marin County high-school students working to reduce teen smoking, vaping and nicotine use, brought the request to the council. The group, which is also working to ban tobacco sales in Ross, reached out to Mayor Holli Thier, who placed the ordinance on the agenda.</p>
<p>Youth advocates cited alarming local statistics. The California Healthy Kids Survey reported that 11% of ninth graders and 16% of 11th graders in the Tamalpais Union High School District — which includes Redwood High School serving the Tiburon Peninsula — used vaping products in 2023-2024, compared to statewide averages of 5% for freshmen and 7% for juniors.</p>
<p>Diana Garcia, a Novato High School junior and one of three Youth Advocacy Committee presenters, said banning tobacco would ensure retailers “don’t enter Tiburon now or in the future.”</...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Sculpted busts recall Tiburon life in the 1950s, ’60s</title>

     <description>Howard Lazar&apos;s exhibit features painted busts and written vignettes reflecting on teachers, shopkeepers and friends.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When sculptor Howard Lazar worked at a coffee shop as a teenager in Tiburon, a railroad worker named Smitty would come in and order from him.</p>
<p>Whether it was a large combo lunch or a slice of pie and a late-afternoon cup of coffee, the railroad worker would always tip the teen $1. Those consistent $1 tips from Smitty, Lazar later discovered, came after the railroad worker learned Lazar was commuting from Tiburon to attend San Francisco State University.</p>
<p>“Cost being what it was, he was trying to help me out,” Lazar says of Smitty.</p>
<p>Smitty is one of eight people Lazar, now 77, has created life-size busts of for his new exhibit, “Notable People I Grew Up Knowing,” which will run Oct. 24-26 at the Belvedere-Tiburon Landmarks Society’s China Cabin. Alongside the busts, Lazar has written vignettes reflecting on how they impacted him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere band keeps community in tune with backyard jam sessions</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-band-keeps-community-in-tune-with-backyard-jam-sessions</link>
     <description>For five years, eight musicians have turned a Belvedere backyard into a weekly community gathering with rock classics and potluck meals.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every Tuesday night for the past five years, rock ’n’ roll has spilled from Mac Couto’s backyard on Laurel Street into the quiet Belvedere evening. Under bistro lights strung across a white marquee tent, eight musicians work through a catalog of more than 300 songs while neighbors arrive with plates of food and bottles of wine.</p>
<p>They call themselves the Windsor Street Blues Band, and on Oct. 10, they brought their neighborhood tradition to a wider stage.</p>
<p>The band opened the second annual Belvedere Home-Made Film Festival at Belvedere Community Park, performing seven songs for a lawn-seated audience of 200 community members before the screening of more than 30 resident-made films on the theme of community. They played classics like “This House is Rockin’,” “The Boxer” and “Monster Mash” — a fitting preview for an evening celebrating what brings neighbors together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Sea Ranch residents say they’ve long enjoyed visiting Tiburon and plan to spend several nights in town before returning to the unincorporated community on the northern Sonoma County coast bordering Mendocino County, where they’ve lived for roughly seven years.</p>
<p>“It’s just a very low-key, convenient, not spread out all over the place kind of place where you can come and go across the street to get dinner and come back,” Beverly says of Tiburon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>New Business: Tiburon entrepreneur launches low-fee platform for tech-savvy homebuyers</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/new-business-tiburon-entrepreneur-launches-low-fee-platform-for-tech-savvy-homebuyers</link>
     <description>The platform charges homebuyers 0.75% compared to traditional agent fees of 2.5% to 3%, potentially saving tens of thousands of dollars.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tiburon resident has launched a real-estate platform that charges homebuyers a quarter of traditional agent fees.</p>
<p>J. Dean Modir, 40, foundedZeego.ai, which launched two weeks ago as an alternative for California homebuyers comfortable doing much of the legwork in searching for a home.</p>
<p>Modir said his website caters to the tech-savvy homebuyer who can analyze data and conduct research independently, while serving as a complement to the homebuying ecosystem. He noted that most homebuyers will still need the support a real-estate agent provides.</p>
<p>“But I started to hear more and more people say, ‘Hey, you know, I already found this property myself, I toured it myself, and I really just need an agent to help me pencil it or get through the offer, maybe get the right forms in place, but I don’t really need that much help outside of that,’” Modir says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon family reunited with missing dog after standoff; woman arrested</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-family-reunited-with-missing-dog-after-standoff-woman-arrested</link>
     <description>Police recover pet after owner tracks it with AirTag.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tiburon woman was arrested Oct. 2 on suspicion of grand theft and resisting police after the owner of a missing dog tracked her cavapoo to the woman’s apartment using an Apple AirTag.</p>
<p>The 60-year-old resident was booked into Marin County Jail and released Oct. 3 after posting bail. The Marin District Attorney’s Office is reviewing the case.</p>
<p>The Ark is not identifying the woman because no charges had been filed by press time Oct. 14.</p>
<p>Police say the woman picked up the 5-year-old cavapoo, named Lani, after it escaped from owners Lea and Timothy Inbody’s yard Oct. 1. Officers obtained a search warrant after the woman allegedly refused to return the dog and demanded $250, flowers and fruit in exchange for its release.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Ark, the woman said she found the dog and had tried to locate its owner. She disputed the allegations against her.</p>
<p>Lea Inbody said Lani disappeared from her backyard and suspected a delivery driver left the gate open, allowing the dog to wander off. It had happened before, Inbody said, and neighbors typically called when they spotted Lani.</p>
<p>This time, no one did.</p>
<p>After hours of searching with no leads, Inbody used her phone to check the location of the AirTag on Lani’s collar. The signal pointed to an apartment at The Hilarita complex on Ned’s Way, about 500 feet downhill of the Inbodys’ Spring Lane home. She knocked repeatedly that afternoon and evening. No one answered.</p>
<p>Inbody said she wondered if the AirTag had fallen off or malfunctioned. As night fell and rain began, she gathered her two sons — ages 2 and 4 — and searched the neighborhood but began losing hope.</p>
<p>“I thought it was so weird that nobody’s seen her,” she said. “I never figured that someone stole my dog. I thought she’d been eaten by a coyote or hit by a car.”</p>
<p>“It was horrible,” she said. “And it was so unfortunate because I have a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old that I’m trying to stay positive for. And they’re crying and looking for their dog.”</p>
<p>The next day, Oct. 2, Inbody posted Lani’s photo online on NextDoor, asking for help. That afternoon, while searching near Ned’s Way again with her older son, a Hilarita resident told Inbody she’d seen the dog with a neighbor, at the same apartment Inbody tried previously.</p>
<p>Inbody says she returned to the apartment and knocked.</p>
<p>“The second I say, ‘dog,’ she deadbolts her door and acts like nobody’s home,” Inbody alleged. “So ...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon Peninsula crew sails to third J105 title in four years</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-peninsula-crew-sails-to-third-j105-title-in-four-years</link>
     <description>Team Niuhi overcame a broken mast two weeks before the regatta to dominate the field.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks before the world’s most prestigious J105 sailing regatta in September, Tiburon skipper Randy Hecht took a phone call in Copenhagen, Denmark, where he was racing 4,000 miles from home.</p>
<p>His crew had just hauled their 7,750-pound keelboat more than 2,600 miles from Belvedere to Toronto in preparation for the J105 North American Championship on Lake Ontario. But the news wasn’t good.</p>
<p>“We had dropped the boat off in the yard in Toronto, and the yard decided to reposition the boat someplace else,” Hecht said. “The mast was on top of the boat, and they accidentally hooked the mast on the corner of some building and bent it.”</p>
<p>The boat, called Niuhi — which means “man-eating shark” in Hawaiian — desperately needed a mast.</p>
<p>“My thought was how can I possibly concentrate on the Copenhagen race and figure out how to deal with this broken mast,” Hecht said. “I got about two weeks to sort it out. I thought about throwing in the towel.”</p>
<p>He didn’t. Instead, the San Francisco Yacht Club-based crew went on to win its third North American Championship in four years, beating 17 other competitors including one of the world’s greatest sailors. The victory at the Sept. 17-20 regatta continued the dominance of a team that has made the Bay Area’s sailing community a national powerhouse in the J105 class — a 34-foot, one-design racing keelboat.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Harband has already raised more than $11,000 toward his $15,000 goal for the Challenged Athletes Foundation&apos;s Million Dollar Challenge.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three times a week, Tiburon resident Jeff Harband rides 20-60 miles on his bicycle. But now the 61-year-old is gearing up for his longest ride yet: a 625-mile trek to raise money for athletes with physical disabilities.</p>
<p>Harband has set a$15,000 fundraising goalfor his Million Dollar Challenge bike ride to benefit the San Diego-based nonprofit Challenged Athletes Foundation. The organization assists those with permanent physical disabilities in pursuing healthy lifestyles and professional athletic competitions, including by providing financial support for adaptive equipment, travel and competition fees.</p>
<p>“As a physical therapist, I’ve always been interested in helping people with disabilities — never really had the chance within my practice,” Harband says, adding that because he didn’t see many people with disabilities in Marin, he views his volunteering work “as a way for me to get more involved with that.”</p>
<p>Alongside 120 other cyclists, some of whom will use adaptive equipment, Harband will bike from Santa Rosa to San Diego Oct. 17-24.</p>]]></content:encoded>
