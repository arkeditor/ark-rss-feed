     <title>Strawberry neighbors sue to block senior housing project</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-neighbors-sue-to-block-senior-housing-project</link>
     <description>The lawsuit claims the county wrongly fast-tracked the project under state housing laws designed to bypass the public review process.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fight over a five-story senior-living complex proposed for a Strawberry hillside has moved from Nextdoor posts and online petitions to Marin Superior Court, where neighbors are challenging the county’s approval of the 106-unit facility as an illegal end-run around environmental laws.</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed Jan. 22 by the group Tiburon Ridge Neighbors and resident Scott Arwin claims the county wrongly fast-tracked the Spirit Living Group project under state housing laws designed to bypass the public review process that typically slows development. But the neighbors say the 3.7-acre project site at 100 Thomas Place, off North Knoll Road, doesn’t qualify for that streamlined approval because it provides habitat for 20 special-status species and requires removal of 22 heritage trees.</p>
<p>The legal battle pits neighbors concerned about traffic, emergency access and environmental destruction against developers who say Marin desperately needs senior housing for its rapidly aging population.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Flood zone faces gap of $3.5 mil for major projects</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/flood-zone-faces-gap-of-3-5-mil-for-major-projects</link>
     <description>Tiburon Peninsula flood officials are facing a financial squeeze.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon Peninsula flood officials face a financial squeeze: They’ve approved spending $594,500 through June 2028 on routine operations such as pump replacement and creek maintenance, but county staff say the zone needs to close a $3.5 million gap between available funds and the cost of three major flood-protection projects.</p>
<p>The Marin Flood Control Zone 4 advisory board voted 4-0 at its Jan. 27 meeting to approve baseline budgets for fiscal years 2026-27 and 2027-28, covering July 1 this year through June 30, 2028. The board has one vacancy.</p>
<p>The operations budget covers expected expenses including contracts for creek maintenance and sediment removal, pump purchases, refurbishments and utilities for pump operations and maintenance, the county said in a staff report.</p>
<p>It does not include major projects such as restoring the East and West creeks, improvements to reduce flooding at and near Greenwood Cove Drive or upgrading a Strawberry Circle levee that was overtopped during historic high tides Jan. 3. Those projects are estimated to cost $9.4 million — $3.5 million more than the $5.9 million projected in Zone 4’s fund at the July 1, 2027, start of fiscal 2028.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belvedere Parks, Open Spaces and Lanes Committee set its 2026 priorities around an “Inform and Improve” theme focused on the city’s walking lanes — with plans to repair deteriorating infrastructure, update signage and create a comprehensive walking map.</p>
<p>Under the “Improve” component, the committee identified a prioritized list of repairs and landscaping work that city staff plans to undertake. That list includes handrail repairs and replacements on Lower McLean, Upper McLean and Corinthian; concrete stair repairs on Lower Cedar, Lower Woodland, Upper Woodland and Corinthian; and tree work on Upper Cedar, Pagoda, Lower Hawthorne at Centennial Park and Park Lane.</p>
<p>Under the “Inform” theme, the committee is working to make information about Belvedere’s public spaces more accessible to residents and visitors. One proposal calls for creating a standalone Belvedere walking map that would be distributed at public events and made available at City Hall.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Marin mayors council agrees to follow state open-meeting laws</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/marin-mayors-council-agrees-to-follow-state-open-meeting-laws</link>
     <description>The vote follows a cease-and-desist letter alleging a Tiburon councilmember blocked a resident from meetings that should have been public.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three weeks after receiving a cease-and-desist letter alleging a Tiburon councilmember blocked a county resident from meetings that should have been public, the Marin County Council of Mayors and Councilmembers voted to follow California’s open-meeting laws.</p>
<p>The county council voted 9-0 at its Jan. 28 teleconference meeting to immediately adhere to the Ralph M. Brown Act for both its general meetings and those of its standing committees by requiring them to be open to the public. San Anselmo representatives were absent, and Corte Madera’s representative left early.</p>
<p>Tiburon Councilmember Alice Fredericks, who chairs the Legislative Committee at the center of the allegations, represented the town in the vote, and Belvedere Mayor Sally Wilkinson voted on the city’s behalf.</p>
<p>The council’s bylaws will be formally amended to acknowledge that the body follows all of the Brown Act’s provisions. That process will begin at its February meeting with formal adoption in March, according to a staff report prepared for the meeting. Both meetings will now occur in person following the council’s vote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Commissioners envision outdoor concerts that celebrate music from different cultures.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heritage and Arts Commission officials are considering a Summer of Love music festival for Tiburon, envisioning outdoor concerts that celebrate music from different cultures.</p>
<p>Commissioners Nora Noguez, Victoria Fong and Jaleh Etemad will develop a proposal for the event and reach out to the town’s Diversity Inclusion Task Force about collaborating.</p>
<p>Noguez, who proposed the idea, said she grew up in San Francisco during the 1970s watching outdoor concerts bring communities together — something she believes is needed now.</p>
<p>“I think especially in these political times when there’s so much division, divisiveness, anger and everything else negative, it would be wonderful to have something very positive that brings everyone together that is nonpartisan but is really just a celebration, essentially, of life,” Noguez said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A ballet teacher at Marin Dance Theatre builds community in Marin</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-ballet-teacher-at-marin-dance-theatre-builds-community-in-marin</link>
     <description>She and a colleague have developed an adaptive dance program for students on the autism spectrum and with other sensory sensitivities.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Between teaching young ballerinas their pliés and older students their pirouettes, Lexi Pittman says she needs a reset. Most mornings, the 25-year-old Marin Dance Theatre instructor walks the waterfront path at Blackie’s Pasture, earbuds in, letting podcasts and bay breezes clear her mind before the afternoon classes begin.</p>
<p>“This is kind of like a reset for my brain,” she says.</p>
<p>But Pittman’s most meaningful work at the San Rafael ballet school goes beyond teaching classical technique. Over the past few years, she and a colleague have developed an adaptive dance program for students on the autism spectrum and dancers with other sensory sensitivities — filling a gap in Marin’s dance community.</p>
<p>“That’s been really eye-opening,” she says. “We’re trying to build more of a community focus in Marin, because there hasn’t really been a program like this here.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

The commission also discussed creating a dedicated space for rotating public-art exhibits, similar to Yountville’s program. (via NickiAdani.com)</media:description>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three Larkspur high schools shut down Thursday after an anonymous voicemail threatened a bomb or shooting at Redwood High School, school officials said.</p>
<p>Redwood, San Andreas and Tamiscal high schools all closed Jan. 29 out of an abundance of caution, according to an announcement posted on the Tamalpais Union High School District website.</p>
<p>A Nixle alert said a threatening voicemail arrived about 8 a.m. Central Marin police advised Redwood administrators to evacuate and close the campus, Principal Barnaby Payne wrote in a letter to families.</p>
<p>All three campuses will remain closed through the end of Thursday. All after-school activities, including athletics, have been canceled. Open house scheduled for Thursday evening also was canceled and will be rescheduled, with details to be announced later.</p>
<p>Families will receive an update on the status of classes Friday via Parent Square later Thursday.</p>
<p>Payne said district administration is working with Central Marin police to investigate.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the threat could be frightening for students and may generate rumors in the community and encouraged parents to discuss the situation with their children and contact the school if follow-up is needed.</p>
<p>Counselors and Wellness Center staff are available at school for students who need support, according to his letter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>City officials are uncertain whether the spike reflects a lasting trend or a temporary surge from large projects.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere collected $868,371 in permit and planning fees during the first half of the fiscal year, a 47% increase over the same period last year, but city officials are uncertain whether the spike reflects a lasting trend or a temporary surge from large projects.</p>
<p>The Finance Committee reviewed the revenue increase during its Jan. 22 meeting as part of the fiscal year 2025-2026 midyear budget review, which the committee recommended 4-0 for City Council acceptance, with member John Wilton absent.</p>
<p>The city issued 665 permits between July 1 and Dec. 31, collecting $868,371 in fees compared to 652 permits and $588,988 in fees during the same period the previous year.

     <description>Cindy Siciliano is aiming to raise $10,000 by early June ahead of another planned humanitarian trip to the Philippines in November.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the death of her mother in early 2024, Cindy Siciliano decided she wanted to take on a service project in the Philippines, where her mom was born, to honor her mother’s memory.</p>
<p>With the support of the Rotary Club of Tiburon Sunset, of which she’s a member, Siciliano visited Samal, an island roughly 609 miles southeast of the capital, Manila, in November 2024, donating backpacks with school supplies and more than 100 10-pound bags of rice to families, while treating local kids to ice cream.</p>
<p>The experience left a lasting impression on Siciliano, who owns Cindy’s Hair Studio on Tiburon Boulevard.</p>
<p>“It’s really touching, you feel like, ‘Wow, we’re so spoiled here,’” she says. “When I saw the kids get just so excited about getting ice cream in line, … you wouldn’t see kids in America jumping up for joy for an ice cream cone like that.”</p>
<p>The Mill Valley resident is now aiming to raise $10,000 by early June ahead of another planned humanitarian trip to the Philippines in November. The money will go toward supporting 400 students with developmental disabilities on Samal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>She says the Tiburon councilmember who chairs the Legislative Committee blocked her from attending and has threatened legal action.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tamalpais Valley resident is threatening legal action against the Marin County Council of Mayors and Councilmembers, alleging the countywide body has violated California’s open-meeting laws for years — and that a Tiburon councilmember has blocked her from attending meetings that should have been public.</p>
<p>Brooke Schreier Ganz and her attorney, Annie Cappetta of Berkeley-based Ferguson Law PC, submitted a cease-and-desist letter Jan. 5 demanding the council comply with the Ralph M. Brown Act by opening standing meetings of its Legislative Committee to the public.</p>
<p>The letter also alleges Tiburon Councilmember Alice Fredericks, who has chaired the Legislative Committee for more than 10 years, told Ganz in August she was not allowed to virtually attend committee meetings, relented temporarily in September, then blocked her from attending a meeting in October.</p>
<p>The county council is scheduled to discuss Jan. 28 whether it qualifies as a Brown Act board, Fredericks said, ahead of a required Feb. 4 deadline to formally respond to the cease-and-desist letter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon Fire finishes downtown upgrades; Paradise work ongoing</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-fire-finishes-downtown-upgrades-paradise-work-ongoing</link>
     <description>Downtown upgrades include expanded gym space, remodeled restrooms, improved emergency exits and the replacement training tower.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon firefighters are breaking in a new steel training tower and expanded facilities at their renovated downtown headquarters as construction crews accelerate work on rebuilding the district’s Paradise Drive station.</p>
<p>The district completed about $872,000 in repairs and upgrades to Station 11 on Tiburon Boulevard, including expanded gym space, remodeled restrooms, improved emergency exits and the replacement training tower. The construction permit was issued in May, and crews are completing final requirements for inspection. The work had been slated for last fiscal year but was delayed due to uncertainty over construction-material costs.</p>
<p>Battalion Chief Daniel Elkington said firefighters have moved into the renovated space and are putting the training tower through its paces.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the district’s Paradise Drive station is undergoing a full rebuild. After a delay at year-end due to water- and soil-integrity issues, construction crews have razed the original structure, installed 50 concrete and rebar piles to support the new building and are forming and pouring retaining walls and bioretention ponds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Herring spawn returns to Tiburon Peninsula</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/herring-spawn-returns-to-tiburon-peninsula</link>
     <description>The six-inch silvery fish spend most of their lives at sea, then return to the bay to spawn in late fall and winter.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a year’s hiatus, Pacific herring have swarmed back into Tiburon Peninsula coves, providing the traditional winter feast for birds and beasts and drawing recreational fishers from around the Bay Area.</p>
<p>The six-inch silvery fish spend most of their lives at sea, then return to the bay to spawn in late fall and winter. Females lay their eggs on substrate like rocks, piers and eelgrass, while males release clouds of milt to fertilize them.</p>
<p>The fish seemed to avoid the Tiburon Peninsula last year but returned in droves this winter.</p>
<p>“It’s encouraging,” said Ken Oda, an environmental scientist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife who monitors herring spawns from his office in Monterey. “We’ve heard good reports of spawning in Richardson Bay, Racoon Strait and one down in San Leandro.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Strawberry Rec approves restoration of eelgrass damaged by dredging</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-rec-approves-restoration-of-eelgrass-damaged-by-dredging</link>
     <description>The contractor will coordinate with the Richardson Bay Regional Agency’s ongoing eelgrass-restoration programs in the bay.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Strawberry Recreation District board unanimously approved a $213,400 contract to restore nearly half an acre of eelgrass along Richardson Bay — a requirement after a 2023 dredging project damaged the protected underwater habitat.</p>
<p>The board voted Jan. 13 to hire San Diego-based Merkel & Associates for the work, which will restore 0.44 acres of eelgrass in Strawberry Channel, the waterway on the east side of Strawberry that provides boat access to the bay.</p>
<p>The firm will coordinate with the Richardson Bay Regional Agency’s ongoing eelgrass-restoration programs, though the Strawberry project remains independent. Merkel has been restoring eelgrass in the bay since 2013, including its work on mooring scars in the agency’s 700-acre eelgrass protection zone.</p>
<p>Work is expected to begin in April and wrap up by July.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Man serving 251 years for Tiburon rape denied parole for five years</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/man-serving-251-years-for-tiburon-rape-denied-parole-for-five-years</link>
     <description>California’s Elderly Parole Program allows inmates 60 or older who have served continuously for at least 25 years to seek review.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frederick Sidney Laird, who received a 251-year prison sentence for a violent rape in Tiburon in 1998, was denied parole for at least five years Jan. 7 after his first parole hearing since his conviction.</p>
<p>Laird, 65, is incarcerated at the Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran. The California Board of Parole Hearings’ decision means his next parole consideration will occur in 2031.</p>
<p>California’s Elderly Parole Program allows inmates 60 or older who have served continuously for at least 25 years to seek review. Laird became eligible under a 2014 federal court order that extended parole consideration to inmates sentenced under California’s three-strikes law.</p>
<p>Laird was convicted in 1999 after pleading guilty to 10 felonies connected to the July 13, 1998, attack. He had responded to a newspaper advertisement placed by a 25-year-old Tiburon woman seeking a roommate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon woman turns midair terror into self-help book on flow states</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-woman-turns-midair-terror-into-self-help-book-on-flow-states</link>
     <description>The book presents a series of brief daily exercises and accounts from people across the globe.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In December 2000, Laurie Smith and her husband, Jim, were flying over Sudan en route to a dream vacation in Kenya when their plane suddenly plummeted 10,000 feet and began flying on its side.</p>
<p>She would find out later that a passenger had burst into the cockpit and attempted to commandeer the plane.</p>
<p>Smith says she thought she was going to die, and she and Jim began to say their last words to each other. But something else happened to Smith in that same moment.</p>
<p>“Almost as if in a trance, I started making Reiki symbols in the air and imagined sending white light to the cockpit,” the Tiburon resident writes in her new book, “The Flow Habit,” which was published Dec. 30 by self-help publisher Hay House. She says “a deep calm” came over her.</p>
<p>Smith, 56, says her experience on the plane was one form of what psychologists call “flow” — the sense of being deeply absorbed, often with a sense of interconnectedness and a feeling that time speeds up or slows down.</p>]]></content:encoded>
