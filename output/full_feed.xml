     <title>Tiburon Peninsula crew sails to third J105 title in four years</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-peninsula-crew-sails-to-third-j105-title-in-four-years</link>
     <description>Team Niuhi overcame a broken mast two weeks before the regatta to dominate the field.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks before the world’s most prestigious J105 sailing regatta in September, Tiburon skipper Randy Hecht took a phone call in Copenhagen, Denmark, where he was racing 4,000 miles from home.</p>
<p>His crew had just hauled their 7,750-pound keelboat more than 2,600 miles from Belvedere to Toronto in preparation for the J105 North American Championship on Lake Ontario. But the news wasn’t good.</p>
<p>“We had dropped the boat off in the yard in Toronto, and the yard decided to reposition the boat someplace else,” Hecht said. “The mast was on top of the boat, and they accidentally hooked the mast on the corner of some building and bent it.”</p>
<p>The boat, called Niuhi — which means “man-eating shark” in Hawaiian — desperately needed a mast.</p>
<p>“My thought was how can I possibly concentrate on the Copenhagen race and figure out how to deal with this broken mast,” Hecht said. “I got about two weeks to sort it out. I thought about throwing in the towel.”</p>
<p>He didn’t. Instead, the San Francisco Yacht Club-based crew went on to win its third North American Championship in four years, beating 17 other competitors including one of the world’s greatest sailors. The victory at the Sept. 17-20 regatta continued the dominance of a team that has made the Bay Area’s sailing community a national powerhouse in the J105 class — a 34-foot, one-design racing keelboat.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon cyclist will embark on 625-mile ride to raise money for disabled athletes</title>

     <description>Harband has already raised more than $11,000 toward his $15,000 goal for the Challenged Athletes Foundation&apos;s Million Dollar Challenge.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three times a week, Tiburon resident Jeff Harband rides 20-60 miles on his bicycle. But now the 61-year-old is gearing up for his longest ride yet: a 625-mile trek to raise money for athletes with physical disabilities.</p>
<p>Harband has set a$15,000 fundraising goalfor his Million Dollar Challenge bike ride to benefit the San Diego-based nonprofit Challenged Athletes Foundation. The organization assists those with permanent physical disabilities in pursuing healthy lifestyles and professional athletic competitions, including by providing financial support for adaptive equipment, travel and competition fees.</p>
<p>“As a physical therapist, I’ve always been interested in helping people with disabilities — never really had the chance within my practice,” Harband says, adding that because he didn’t see many people with disabilities in Marin, he views his volunteering work “as a way for me to get more involved with that.”</p>
<p>Alongside 120 other cyclists, some of whom will use adaptive equipment, Harband will bike from Santa Rosa to San Diego Oct. 17-24.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>A uniform 8 mph speed limit and separate paths for cyclists and pedestrians are among the potential changes being explored.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A uniform 8 mph speed limit, separate paths for cyclists and pedestrians and better visibility at intersections are among the safety improvements Tiburon may consider for the Old Rail Trail between San Rafael Avenue and Blackie’s Pasture.</p>
<p>The town’s Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission voted unanimously Sept. 30 to appoint Vice Chair Mike Ghaffary and member Chuck Hornbrook to a subcommittee that will develop recommendations for the heavily used stretch.</p>
<p>The town’s parks master plan, adopted in 2024, calls for designing interventions to slow speeds and establish clear understanding of shared space. The plan also suggests creating separate bike and pedestrian paths where adequate right of way exists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Signed, worn, remembered: Tiburon collector preserves moments that shaped him</title>

     <description>Scanlon&apos;s 200-piece collection includes Dwight Clark&apos;s cleats, Reggie Jackson&apos;s bat and even locks of hair from an unnamed Beatle.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Tiburon resident Kevin Scanlon, cleats autographed by 49ers legend Dwight Clark aren’t just old shoes. A bat used by Reggie Jackson isn’t just a slab of wood. And those locks of hair from an unnamed Beatle aren’t just a curiosity.</p>
<p>They’re memories — things that remind him of growing up.</p>
<p>“We always collect things in the past that made us feel good or that we remember,” says Scanlon, 64, who has spent three decades building a collection of more than 200 pieces of sports and music memorabilia.</p>
<p>His treasures span Bay Area sports history, from the San Francisco 49ers and Giants and Golden State Warriors to the former Oakland Raiders and Athletics. His music collection centers on The Beatles, including the locks preserved in their original plastic bag— though Scanlon notes the Beatle was never identified.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A relaxing escape fishing off Elephant Rock pier</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-relaxing-escape-fishing-off-elephant-rock-pier</link>
     <description>Hernandez documents his Bay Area fishing adventures on social media, where he connected with his friend Benitez over their shared hobby.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joseph Hernandez stands at the end of Elephant Rock pier Oct. 1 and whips his fishing rod through the air. The white rubber lure, fashioned to look like a tiny minnow, sails 100 feet or so before landing in the bay.</p>
<p>Hernandez, 19, and his friend Robert Benitez, 20, wait for signs of a bite. The two say fishing is a favorite pastime. Hernandez points to the water as a sea lion emerges on the surface.</p>
<p>“Look at this guy,” he says. “They’re always out here. The birds, the waves, the sounds. There’s always something out here.”</p>
<p>Hernandez frequently documents his Bay Area fishing adventures on TikTok under the handle @mond0.joj0 and on Instagram under the handle @mondo.joj0.</p>
<p>It was through social media that Hernandez, who is from Santa Rosa, and Benitez, who is from Novato, became friends. Benitez says he reached out to Hernandez on social media after seeing one of Hernandez’s videos, and the two hit it off. Hernandez is a roofer by trade, often doing jobs in Marin County, while Benitez is studying at Santa Rosa Junior College to earn his emergency medical responder certification in hopes of eventually becoming a firefighter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Zheng takes Tiburon Challenger crown in flawless week</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/zheng-takes-tiburon-challenger-crown-in-flawless-week</link>
     <description>The Columbia University senior didn&apos;t drop a single set en route to his third consecutive Challenger title.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Zheng boarded his red-eye flight back to Columbia University with some newly minted silverware in his carry-on bag — the Tiburon Challenger men’s singles trophy.</p>
<p>Zheng, a senior at the school and the defending NCAA Division I men’s singles champion, defeated fellow American Tyler Zink in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4, on Oct. 5 at the Tiburon Peninsula Club. The 21-year-old didn’t have much time to savor the victory, though — he had to head to the airport to get home in time for a Spanish test the following morning.</p>
<p>His win came one day after the tournament’s doubles final, in which the top-seeded pairing of Finn Reynolds and James Watt, both of New Zealand, defeated Americans Benjamin Kittay and Joshua Sheehy Oct. 4 in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3. The doubles win for Reynolds and Watt marked sweet revenge for the Kiwis: They lost to Kittay and Sheehy in the final at the Las Vegas Tennis Open on Sept. 27.</p>
<p>Both matches were the culmination of the weeklong tournament that began Sept. 28. Players in the Challenger Tour are trying to earn enough points to become eligible to enter the ATP Tour and Grand Slam tournaments, which include Wimbledon and the Australian, French and U.S. Opens.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon picks designers to bring new life to town&apos;s parks</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-picks-designers-to-bring-new-life-to-town-s-parks</link>
     <description>Community feedback from two years of engagement will guide designers creating plans for the former sanitation ponds site and mini parks.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon moved a step closer to upgrading the former sanitation ponds site and three neighborhood mini parks, with a town commission selecting two design firms to create plans for potential amenities including beach-volleyball courts and new swings.</p>
<p>The Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission on Sept. 30 unanimously recommended the Town Council hire Mill Valley-based RHAA Landscape Architecture and Planning for the former ponds site near McKegney Green and nearby Belveron Mini Park. It also recommended Santa Rosa-based Carlile Macy Inc. to do the same for Cypress Hollow Park and the Bel Aire play area.</p>
<p>The total design costs are estimated to reach at least $500,000, $289,712 for RHAA and $209,838 for Carlile Macy. The scope of work for both includes creating a conceptual and final design and developing community-engagement plans. Any actual construction would need to be vetted and approved by both the parks commission and Town Council, with opportunities for public comment.</p>
<p>The council is tentatively set to vote on the recommendation at its Oct. 15 meeting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Tiburon to remove invasive weeds at Railroad Marsh after condo residents report rat infestation linked to overgrown vegetation behind units.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will remove invasive weeds and plants behind Point Tiburon Marsh condominiums after residents complained the overgrown vegetation is contributing to a rat infestation — a renewed attempt at maintenance after work was halted in October 2023 when a biologist spotted what was believed to be a threatened California red-legged frog.</p>
<p>Lafayette-based DK Environmental & Construction Services Inc. will begin removing emerging aquatic weeds, invasive blackberry bushes and other nonaquatic vegetation this month along the southern edge of Railroad Marsh, which sits off Mar West Street behind the Belvedere-Tiburon Library, Tiburon Town Hall and the 34-unit condo complex on Marsh Road.</p>
<p>That 2023 maintenance work to clear 750 tons of cattails was roughly 70% complete but did not resume following the work stoppage, leaving part of the marsh overgrown. The California red-legged frog is listed as threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Journalist Priya David Clemens launches studio to create personal documentaries. Her first film profiles Tiburon surgeon Angelo Capozzi.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strawberry resident and longtime journalist Priya David Clemens decided to honor her father ahead of his 75th birthday by creating a video of his life story to showcase at his party.</p>
<p>The response to the video was overwhelmingly positive, she says. She showed the video again at her father’s memorial service in 2024; he died at the age of 84 after battling dementia for two years and, at the time of his death, was unable to recall or share many of his memories, she says.</p>
<p>After the memorial screening, Clemens says she was approached by many attendees with the same sentiment: “I wish I had this for my mom or my dad. I wish that I could do something like this.”</p>
<p>The experience prompted Clemens to createKeepsake Studios, a business that creates personal documentaries of people, couples and families for special occasions.The company’s first completed documentary is of Tiburon resident Angelo Capozzi, the 92-year-old plastic surgeon who cofounded Rotaplast, a nonprofit that provides surgery to children with a cleft lip or palate anomalies who otherwise would not receive treatment. Since 1992, the organization has conducted 372 missions to perform surgery on nearly 22,000 patients.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounter: A couple savors the moment on shores of Richardson Bay</title>

     <description>Wade and Norleak Winblad find tranquility along Richardson Bay, reflecting on simple living and appreciating everyday moments.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wade and Norleak Winblad dip their toes into Richardson Bay near Greenwood Cove Drive Sept. 24, savoring a quiet moment in camping chairs along the water’s edge.</p>
<p>Wade says the water temperature is not as cold as he expected.</p>
<p>“It just makes me want to jump in and go swimming out there,” he says — though he resists the urge. “I know when you get past your waist or so, it’s a whole different world.”</p>
<p>The Corte Madera couple, married 11 years, were seeking relief from last week’s muggy mini heat wave. Wade says soaking their feet in the water is therapeutic. The week’s temperatures reached the high 80s Sept. 23 and the high 70s the following day — mild for Norleak, who hails from Cambodia.</p>
<p>“It’s like 100 degrees every day there,” she says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Apple design icon Jony Ive buys four Belvedere homes for $73 million</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/apple-design-icon-jony-ive-buys-four-belvedere-homes-for-73-million</link>
     <description>The off-market deal includes historic Locksley Hall, now twice Marin’s priciest-ever sale.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Off-market deal includes historic Locksley Hall, now twice Marin’s priciest-ever sale</p>
<p>By TYLER CALLISTER and KEVIN HESSEL</p>
<p>Billionaire designer Jony Ive quietly purchased four Belvedere Island homes for $73 million last month, including the $43.5-million Locksley Hall mansion — itself the largest residential sale in Marin County since the historic home was last sold a decade ago.</p>
<p>Better known locally as the Blanding House, the three-story, 9,235-square-foot home at on Golden Gate Avenue sits atop the city’s southern peak and features sweeping 270-degree views of the San Francisco skyline and Golden Gate and Bay bridges.</p>
<p>The package also included two flanking properties, the $14.62-million Organ House once part of the larger Blanding estate and another Golden Gate Avenue home for $6.9 million, as well as a $7.98-million home below on Beach Road that sits on Belvedere Cove.</p>
<p>Transaction records show all four sales closed Aug. 28.</p>
<p>Ive, best known for his tenure as Apple’s chief product designer, apparently acquired the properties through a privately brokered, off-market transaction from venture capitalist Matt Cohler.</p>
<p>Cohler purchased Locksley Hall for a record-setting $47.5 million in August 2015 under an LLC, then scooped up the others under different LLCs in June and December 2021. All were linked to Apercen Partners, a Palo Alto-based tax-consulting firm that has represented executives and alumni of Facebook and its parent, Meta.Federal Elections Commission records show that includes Cohler.After helping to launch LinkedIn, Cohler was one of Facebook’s five original employees and its vice president of product sales. As a venture capitalist, he has backed Dropbox, Instagram and Tinder.</p>
<p>It's unclear what Ive intends to do with the properties.</p>
<p>“Sorry to be so unhelpful, but this would be a ‘decline to comment’ I’m afraid,” his communications chief, Sarah O’Brien, said in a Sept. 24 email.</p>
<p>Ive famously designed the colorful original iMacs and the iPhone, joining Apple in 1992 and becoming the design chief in 2015. After leaving in 2019, he co-founded LoveFrom, a “creative collective” that has worked on industrial design, technology and branding with Ferrari, Airbnb and ChatGPT creator OpenAI.</p>
<p>In July, OpenAI completed its $6.4 billion acquisition of Ive’s AI hardware startup, io Products, with Ive and LoveFrom poised to design a line of AI-enabled devices. Before the acquisition ann...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon police plan DUI checkpoint, saturation patrol</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-police-plan-dui-checkpoint-saturation-patrol</link>
     <description>The Tiburon Police Department will conduct impaired driving enforcement operations Sept. 26 and 27.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Police Department will conduct two impaired driving enforcement operations this week, with an overnight DUI checkpoint and saturation patrols.</p>
<p>The checkpoint will run 8 p.m. Sept. 26 to 3 a.m. 27 at an undisclosed location, according to a news release. Officers will then conduct saturation patrols from 7 p.m. 27 to 3 a.m. 28, actively looking for drivers suspected of driving under the influence.</p>
<p>DUI checkpoint locations are determined based on data showing incidents of impaired driving-related crashes, the department said.</p>
<p>Impaired driving extends beyond alcohol. Some prescription medications and over-the-counter drugs may interfere with driving. While medicinal and recreational marijuana are legal, driving under the influence of marijuana remains illegal.</p>
<p>Drivers charged with a first-time DUI face an average of $13,500 in fines and penalties, as well as a suspended license.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon rejects 8 of 9 grand jury critiques on housing</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-rejects-8-of-9-grand-jury-critiques-on-housing</link>
     <description>Tiburon officials agreed with only one of nine findings in a Marin grand jury report on housing mandates, following Belvedere&apos;s lead.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon officials agreed with only one of nine findings in a Marin civil grand jury report that criticized local jurisdictions for not doing enough to meet state housing mandates, following Belvedere’s lead from earlier this month.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously Sept. 16 to approve its formal response to the grand jury’s June report titled “The Worrisome Future of Marin Housing,” which will be signed and returned by Town Manager Greg Chanis. The Marin Board of Supervisors, Tiburon and the county’s 10 other incorporated municipalities were required to respond by Sept. 24.</p>
<p>The grand jury report blames “economic reality” rather than local resistance in asserting that all Marin jurisdictions, including Tiburon, will fall short of meeting state housing mandates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Arthur Drooker, 71, left three-decade TV career at 50 after father&apos;s death to pursue photography.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At 50, Arthur Drooker’s life took a dramatic turn. His father had recently died, and his three-decade career as a Los Angeles TV writer and producer was getting stale. He longed for something deeper.</p>
<p>Dooker says his next choice was the best decision he ever made.</p>
<p>“I realized if there’s anything I really want to do with my life, I’ve got to do it now,” says Drooker, who stopped to chat Sept. 17 while on a bike ride at Shoreline Park. “And I was always a very self-motivated guy, but I was even more motivated now. And that’s when I decided, ‘What makes me happy?’”</p>
<p>For Drooker, now 71, the answer was photography.</p>]]></content:encoded>
