     <title>Belvedere&apos;s fee revenue surges 47% after July hikes</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-s-fee-revenue-surges-47-after-july-hikes</link>
     <description>City officials are uncertain whether the spike reflects a lasting trend or a temporary surge from large projects.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere collected $868,371 in permit and planning fees during the first half of the fiscal year, a 47% increase over the same period last year, but city officials are uncertain whether the spike reflects a lasting trend or a temporary surge from large projects.</p>
<p>The Finance Committee reviewed the revenue increase during its Jan. 22 meeting as part of the fiscal year 2025-2026 midyear budget review, which the committee recommended 4-0 for City Council acceptance, with member John Wilton absent.</p>
<p>The city issued 665 permits between July 1 and Dec. 31, collecting $868,371 in fees compared to 652 permits and $588,988 in fees during the same period the previous year. The increase follows implementation of Belvedere’s first comprehensive user-fee schedule, which took effect July 1.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Cindy’s salon owner turns family loss into service abroad</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/cindy-s-salon-owner-turns-family-loss-into-service-abroad</link>
     <description>Cindy Siciliano is aiming to raise $10,000 by early June ahead of another planned humanitarian trip to the Philippines in November.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the death of her mother in early 2024, Cindy Siciliano decided she wanted to take on a service project in the Philippines, where her mom was born, to honor her mother’s memory.</p>
<p>With the support of the Rotary Club of Tiburon Sunset, of which she’s a member, Siciliano visited Samal, an island roughly 609 miles southeast of the capital, Manila, in November 2024, donating backpacks with school supplies and more than 100 10-pound bags of rice to families, while treating local kids to ice cream.</p>
<p>The experience left a lasting impression on Siciliano, who owns Cindy’s Hair Studio on Tiburon Boulevard.</p>
<p>“It’s really touching, you feel like, ‘Wow, we’re so spoiled here,’” she says. “When I saw the kids get just so excited about getting ice cream in line, … you wouldn’t see kids in America jumping up for joy for an ice cream cone like that.”</p>
<p>The Mill Valley resident is now aiming to raise $10,000 by early June ahead of another planned humanitarian trip to the Philippines in November. The money will go toward supporting 400 students with developmental disabilities on Samal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Activist alleges Marin mayors’ council violates open-meeting law</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/activist-alleges-marin-mayors-council-violates-open-meeting-law</link>
     <description>She says the Tiburon councilmember who chairs the Legislative Committee blocked her from attending and has threatened legal action.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tamalpais Valley resident is threatening legal action against the Marin County Council of Mayors and Councilmembers, alleging the countywide body has violated California’s open-meeting laws for years — and that a Tiburon councilmember has blocked her from attending meetings that should have been public.</p>
<p>Brooke Schreier Ganz and her attorney, Annie Cappetta of Berkeley-based Ferguson Law PC, submitted a cease-and-desist letter Jan. 5 demanding the council comply with the Ralph M. Brown Act by opening standing meetings of its Legislative Committee to the public.</p>
<p>The letter also alleges Tiburon Councilmember Alice Fredericks, who has chaired the Legislative Committee for more than 10 years, told Ganz in August she was not allowed to virtually attend committee meetings, relented temporarily in September, then blocked her from attending a meeting in October.</p>
<p>The county council is scheduled to discuss Jan. 28 whether it qualifies as a Brown Act board, Fredericks said, ahead of a required Feb. 4 deadline to formally respond to the cease-and-desist letter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon Fire finishes downtown upgrades; Paradise work ongoing</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-fire-finishes-downtown-upgrades-paradise-work-ongoing</link>
     <description>Downtown upgrades include expanded gym space, remodeled restrooms, improved emergency exits and the replacement training tower.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon firefighters are breaking in a new steel training tower and expanded facilities at their renovated downtown headquarters as construction crews accelerate work on rebuilding the district’s Paradise Drive station.</p>
<p>The district completed about $872,000 in repairs and upgrades to Station 11 on Tiburon Boulevard, including expanded gym space, remodeled restrooms, improved emergency exits and the replacement training tower. The construction permit was issued in May, and crews are completing final requirements for inspection. The work had been slated for last fiscal year but was delayed due to uncertainty over construction-material costs.</p>
<p>Battalion Chief Daniel Elkington said firefighters have moved into the renovated space and are putting the training tower through its paces.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the district’s Paradise Drive station is undergoing a full rebuild. After a delay at year-end due to water- and soil-integrity issues, construction crews have razed the original structure, installed 50 concrete and rebar piles to support the new building and are forming and pouring retaining walls and bioretention ponds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Herring spawn returns to Tiburon Peninsula</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/herring-spawn-returns-to-tiburon-peninsula</link>
     <description>The six-inch silvery fish spend most of their lives at sea, then return to the bay to spawn in late fall and winter.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a year’s hiatus, Pacific herring have swarmed back into Tiburon Peninsula coves, providing the traditional winter feast for birds and beasts and drawing recreational fishers from around the Bay Area.</p>
<p>The six-inch silvery fish spend most of their lives at sea, then return to the bay to spawn in late fall and winter. Females lay their eggs on substrate like rocks, piers and eelgrass, while males release clouds of milt to fertilize them.</p>
<p>The fish seemed to avoid the Tiburon Peninsula last year but returned in droves this winter.</p>
<p>“It’s encouraging,” said Ken Oda, an environmental scientist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife who monitors herring spawns from his office in Monterey. “We’ve heard good reports of spawning in Richardson Bay, Racoon Strait and one down in San Leandro.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Strawberry Rec approves restoration of eelgrass damaged by dredging</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-rec-approves-restoration-of-eelgrass-damaged-by-dredging</link>
     <description>The contractor will coordinate with the Richardson Bay Regional Agency’s ongoing eelgrass-restoration programs in the bay.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Strawberry Recreation District board unanimously approved a $213,400 contract to restore nearly half an acre of eelgrass along Richardson Bay — a requirement after a 2023 dredging project damaged the protected underwater habitat.</p>
<p>The board voted Jan. 13 to hire San Diego-based Merkel & Associates for the work, which will restore 0.44 acres of eelgrass in Strawberry Channel, the waterway on the east side of Strawberry that provides boat access to the bay.</p>
<p>The firm will coordinate with the Richardson Bay Regional Agency’s ongoing eelgrass-restoration programs, though the Strawberry project remains independent. Merkel has been restoring eelgrass in the bay since 2013, including its work on mooring scars in the agency’s 700-acre eelgrass protection zone.</p>
<p>Work is expected to begin in April and wrap up by July.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Man serving 251 years for Tiburon rape denied parole for five years</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/man-serving-251-years-for-tiburon-rape-denied-parole-for-five-years</link>
     <description>California’s Elderly Parole Program allows inmates 60 or older who have served continuously for at least 25 years to seek review.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frederick Sidney Laird, who received a 251-year prison sentence for a violent rape in Tiburon in 1998, was denied parole for at least five years Jan. 7 after his first parole hearing since his conviction.</p>
<p>Laird, 65, is incarcerated at the Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran. The California Board of Parole Hearings’ decision means his next parole consideration will occur in 2031.</p>
<p>California’s Elderly Parole Program allows inmates 60 or older who have served continuously for at least 25 years to seek review. Laird became eligible under a 2014 federal court order that extended parole consideration to inmates sentenced under California’s three-strikes law.</p>
<p>Laird was convicted in 1999 after pleading guilty to 10 felonies connected to the July 13, 1998, attack. He had responded to a newspaper advertisement placed by a 25-year-old Tiburon woman seeking a roommate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon woman turns midair terror into self-help book on flow states</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-woman-turns-midair-terror-into-self-help-book-on-flow-states</link>
     <description>The book presents a series of brief daily exercises and accounts from people across the globe.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In December 2000, Laurie Smith and her husband, Jim, were flying over Sudan en route to a dream vacation in Kenya when their plane suddenly plummeted 10,000 feet and began flying on its side.</p>
<p>She would find out later that a passenger had burst into the cockpit and attempted to commandeer the plane.</p>
<p>Smith says she thought she was going to die, and she and Jim began to say their last words to each other. But something else happened to Smith in that same moment.</p>
<p>“Almost as if in a trance, I started making Reiki symbols in the air and imagined sending white light to the cockpit,” the Tiburon resident writes in her new book, “The Flow Habit,” which was published Dec. 30 by self-help publisher Hay House. She says “a deep calm” came over her.</p>
<p>Smith, 56, says her experience on the plane was one form of what psychologists call “flow” — the sense of being deeply absorbed, often with a sense of interconnectedness and a feeling that time speeds up or slows down.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Malik Lamar says his goal is financial independence and imagines starting a business someday.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malik Lamar stands by the water at Blackie’s Pasture on the evening of Jan. 22, taking in the views he says feel calmer than anywhere else he’s lived.</p>
<p>“I like the water and like the wind out here,” says Malik, 16. “It’s got better air quality.”</p>
<p>Malik moved to Tiburon a few months ago from Santa Rosa with his mother, who, he says, wanted better schools for him. She’s studying real estate and working a side job.</p>
<p>Malik, meanwhile, is learning the town by walking its paths, shooting hoops alone on neighborhood courts and imagining what it might take to one day own one of the hillside houses he admires.</p>
<p>He says his goal in life is simple: “Making money.” He imagines starting a business someday, though he’s not sure what kind yet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Strawberry resident launches flood app based on the tides</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-resident-launches-flood-app-based-on-the-tides</link>
     <description>The app faces its first real-world test this week: NOAA projects higher-than-normal king tides Jan. 29-Feb. 2.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Strawberry resident has developed and published a new iPhone app that predicts which Marin roads will flood based on tide heights — and it’s about to face its first major test.</p>
<p>Marc Hoag, 46, spent the early days of the new year working on the idea following flooding along the Tiburon Peninsula in early January. He shared a screenshot of his work-in-progress on Nextdoor, the hyperlocal social-media forum, asking neighbors if they’d find such an app useful.</p>
<p>The response was immediate, with more than 200 reactions and many commenters urging him to build the app.</p>
<p>Roughly 24 hours after sharing his idea, Hoag on Jan. 16 published FloodRoute, an iOS-only app that uses tide data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, flood-zone data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and road-elevation mapping to project which roads will flood.</p>
<p>The app faces its first real-world test this week. NOAA projects higher-than-normal king tides Jan. 29-Feb. 2, with high tides between 6.38 and 6.7 feet at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dock in Sausalito, peaking at 9:40 a.m. Jan. 31.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Residents may see smoke rising from Angel Island as early as Jan. 26.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon Peninsula residents may see smoke rising from Angel Island as early as Jan. 26, when California State Parks plans to begin burning vegetation piles at the state park.</p>
<p>The burn operation, which received conditional approval from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, could continue through Jan. 29 or 30 depending on weather conditions.</p>
<p>"These burns are being conducted to help manage invasive species, reduce fuel loading and to promote the resilience of the parks grasslands and oak woodlands in the event of future fires," parks scientistNaftali Moedsaid in a press release.</p>
<p>Officials are urging residents not to call 911 if they spot smoke coming from the island.</p>
<p>State Parks will post updates online as conditions change. The agency can cancel the burns at any time if weather becomes unfavorable.</p>

     <description>The additional work incldues police facility upgrades, storm-drain assessments and a shoreline cleanup.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere will allocate $1.03 million from an unexpected budget surplus to shore up Beach Road’s crumbling seawall and fund police facility upgrades, storm-drain assessments and a shoreline cleanup.</p>
<p>The City Council voted unanimously Jan. 12 to allocate the funds, with $830,000 going to the seawall and $200,000 split among the other projects, on the recommendation of the city’s Finance Committee.</p>
<p>The allocation follows fiscal 2024-2025, which ended June 30, 2025, when revenues exceeded projections by $1.76 million — a windfall that created $1.38 million in excess reserves after meeting the city’s reserve requirements. The remaining $350,000 stays in the general fund as a financial buffer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere honors pandemic leaders as Citizen of the Year, Emeritus</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-honors-pandemic-leaders-as-citizen-of-the-year-emeritus</link>
     <description>The city will honor Nancy Kemnitzer and Pam Martori at its 46th annual town hall meeting Jan. 27.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the coronavirus pandemic hit in March 2020, Nancy Kemnitzer was nine months into her term as Belvedere’s mayor, grappling with how to keep residents safe through the crisis. That same month, Pam Martori stood in an empty church hall packing brown-bag lunches for people whose meal programs had vanished overnight.</p>
<p>Nearly six years later, the city will honor both Jan. 27 for their pandemic-era service and decades of community contributions. Kemnitzer has been named Belvedere’s 2025 Citizen of the Year. Martori received the Citizen Emeritus honor.</p>
<p>Kemnitzer served a decade on the Planning Commission before her 2016 move to the City Council. She served eight years on the council, including 1½ years as mayor from July 2019 to December 2020. She has also volunteered as a neighborhood block captain.</p>
<p>“Her actions define volunteerism for the selfless betterment of the community,” said Peyton Stein, chair of the Citizen of the Year Committee, which is made up of past honorees and makes the annual selection.</p>
<p>Martori has made her mark through a different kind of service. Under her leadership, volunteers assemble more than 100 sandwich lunches each week for the St. Vincent de Paul Free Dining Room in San Rafael and for residents of The Hilarita apartments in Tiburon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Peninsula claimed half of Marin’s 10 most-expensive home sales in 2025, led by billionaire designer Jony Ive’s $43.5-million purchase of the Locksley Hall mansion in Belvedere — the priciest single-family-home transaction in the county last year and more than $20 million higher than the second most-expensive sale.</p>
<p>Ive bought the three-story, 9,235-square-foot home at 440 Golden Gate Ave., better known locally as the Blanding House, on Aug. 28. The purchase was the county’s largest residential sale since the historic property was last sold for $47.5 million in 2015, some $25.6 million higher than the second-ranked 2025 sale of $17.9-million for a home at 174 Seadrift Road in Stinson Beach.</p>
<p>The Blanding House was part of a four-home, $73-million off-market package that also included the Organ House at 433 Golden Gate Ave., which sold for $14.62 million and ranked sixth in the county; 432 Golden Gate Ave., which sold for $6.9 million; and 330 Beach Road, which sits below the homes on Belvedere Cove and sold for $7.98 million.</p>
<p>Beyond Ive’s purchases, the peninsula’s top 10 sales included 34 Eucalyptus Road in Belvedere, which ranked fourth at $15 million; 8 Eucalyptus Road in Belvedere, which ranked 10th at $13 million; and 275 Diviso St. in Tiburon, which ranked eighth at $13.22 million.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon parents to be honored for decades of cystic fibrosis advocacy</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-parents-to-be-honored-for-decades-of-cystic-fibrosis-advocacy</link>
     <description>Tiburon residents Michael and Bonnie Rose are receiving the 2026 Breath of Life Award from the Northern California chapter of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation during its gala Feb. 28 in San Francisco. The Roses are longtime supporters of the foundation, with efforts bolstered following their daughter Katie’s diagnosis with the disease in 2001. (via Bonnie Rose) After Bonnie and Michael Rose welcomed their third child, Katie, in 2001, they knew “something was off right away,” Bonnie says.  ...</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Bonnie and Michael Rose welcomed their third child, Katie, in 2001, they knew “something was off right away,” Bonnie says.</p>
<p>Katie wasn’t gaining weight and was experiencing stomach aches — symptoms her older sisters, Chelsea and Kayla, didn’t have as newborns.</p>
<p>At just eight weeks old, Katie was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, pancreas and other organs. Both Bonnie and her husband carry the gene that causes cystic fibrosis, but they didn’t know it at the time.</p>
<p>“We just all of a sudden realized that this third kid, which was supposed to be easy because we know how to do this, we didn’t know how to do any of this,” Bonnie says. “And we were going to need help.”</p>
<p>The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a nonprofit that aims to cure the disease while funding research and drug development and advancing specialized care for those living with the disorder, became a major resource for the Tiburon family. The Roses, in turn, became dedicated to the organization, with Bonnie, the principal adviser and owner of Rose College Strategies, organizing and chairing various foundation-related galas and Michael financially supporting the foundation through his dry-cleaning company, Vogue Cleaners on Tiburon Boulevard.</p>
<p>On Feb. 28, the couple will be honored with the Breath of Life Award at the Breath of Life Gala, hosted by the foundation’s Northern California chapter at the Westin St. Francis in San Francisco.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>New Belvedere police officer brings Mill Valley experience to smaller force</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/new-belvedere-police-officer-brings-mill-valley-experience-to-smaller-force</link>
     <description>Preston’s hire brings some long-awaited relief to the Belvedere department, which had been operating with only four officers.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After spending just over two years as an officer with the Mill Valley Police Department, Tyler Preston was ready for a change — and he says he’s found it in Belvedere.</p>
<p>“Mill Valley is a lot busier than Belvedere so far,” says Preston, who joined the city’s Police Department as a patrol officer Jan. 4 and was ceremonially sworn in at the Jan. 12 City Council meeting. “I basically just wanted something a little more slow-paced, where I can spend time with the family and essentially not take anything home.”</p>
<p>Preston’s hire at an annual salary of $104,484 brings some long-awaited relief to the Belvedere department, which had been operating with only four officers. That’s resulted in long shifts, schedule adjustments and part-time officers to maintain 24-hour coverage, with support from the Tiburon Police Department during extended absences, officials have said.</p>
<p>Adding Preston brings the department to five patrol officers, what officials have called “manageable” but still one below “ideal.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jim Gaither Jr. peers through his binoculars at Railroad Marsh on Jan. 14, listening for distinct bird calls echoing across the water.</p>
<p>In about 12 minutes, he’s spotted 14 bird species — mallards, pied-billed grebes, great blue herons and white-crowned sparrows — all recorded in his list on eBird, an app and website created by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.</p>
<p>“That’s more than one species a minute,” says the 63-year-old San Rafael resident, whose parents, Jim and Susan, live on the Belvedere Lagoon.</p>
<p>He points to a great blue heron perched on the marsh’s banks.</p>
<p>“As we come into late winter and spring, they start developing their breeding plumage and terrific colors and plumes,” Gaither says. “They’re just a wonderful bird.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Applications open for Reed school board seat through Feb. 3; interviews Feb. 6</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/applications-open-for-reed-school-board-seat-through-feb-3-interviews-feb-6</link>
     <description>Tiburon Peninsula residents have until 4 p.m. Feb. 3 to apply for an interim seat on the Reed Union School District board of trustees.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon Peninsula residents have until 4 p.m. Feb. 3 to apply for an interim seat on the Reed Union School District board of trustees.</p>
<p>The vacancy was created when Sherry Wangenheim resigned in December, one year before her term was set to expire. Wangenheim, who had served on the board since 2017, is moving to London with her family later this year.</p>
<p>The chosen candidate will serve the remainder of Wangenheim’s term, through early December 2026, and can run for a full four-year term in the Nov. 3 general election.</p>
<p>The district board voted 4-0 at its Jan. 13 meeting to fill the seat by appointment rather than calling for a special election, citing a desire to minimize costs and fill the vacancy sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>The seat is open to any registered voter living within school district boundaries, which include Tiburon, Belvedere, Paradise Cay and east Corte Madera.</p>
<p>Application materials are available by emailingrusdsuperintendent@reedschools.orgor for pickup at the district office, 277A Karen Way, Tiburon, at Bel Aire Elementary School. Completed applications should be sent to the same email address or dropped off at the district office.</p>
<p>Applicants must be available to be interviewed at a special Feb. 6 board meeting, which will be open to the public. The board is expected to make an appointment immediately following the interviews.</p>
<p>For more information, call the district office at 415-381-1112.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Point Tiburon Plaza parking lot could get nine townhomes</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/point-tiburon-plaza-parking-lot-could-get-nine-townhomes</link>
     <description>A developer plans to build nine three-story townhomes under state laws that would override zoning requirements for lot size and density.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A developer plans to build nine three-story townhomes on part of the Point Tiburon Plaza parking lot under state laws that would override Tiburon’s zoning requirements for lot size and density.</p>
<p>Black Oak Ventures is working with property owner Chong Cook to subdivide a portion of the plaza at 1801 Tiburon Blvd. into nine lots for townhomes. The lots would total 17,720 square feet of the existing 87,120-square-foot parcel. The remaining 69,400 square feet would continue as parking.</p>
<p>Tiburon received the proposal Nov. 20 under Senate Bill 1123, the Starter Home Revitalization Act. Under the law, towns must ministerially approve qualifying projects — automatic approval if objective standards are met, with no public hearings or discretionary review. SB 1123 applies to developments of 10 homes or fewer on vacant lots in single-family zones, expanding on SB 684, which created the streamlined process for up to 10 units on lots zoned for multifamily development.</p>
<p>While the law requires approval or denial within 60 days of receiving a completed application, Senior Planner Neal Toft said Jan. 16 the town notified the owner and developer Dec. 19 that the application was incomplete — “so no decision is required at this time,” Toft said.</p>
<p>Black Oak Ventures founder and managing partner Michael Yarne told The Ark in a Jan. 16 phone interview he intends to refile a completed application by late January or early February, restarting the 60-day review window.</p>]]></content:encoded>
