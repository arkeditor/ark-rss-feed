      <title>Owner: Cinelounge won’t close this week despite fundraising urgency</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/owner-cinelounge-won-t-close-this-week-despite-fundraising-urgency</link>
      <description>Email campaign was a ‘Hail Mary’ to generate support for the transition to a nonprofit.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon resident Christian Meoli says his downtown movie theater won’t close this week, despite a fundraising campaign that suggested Cinelounge needed to raise $500,000 by April 21 to survive.</p>
<p>Meoli, who co-owns the theater with his wife Camilla, acknowledged the messaging was a deliberate “Hail Mary” approach after earlier announcements about the theater’s planned transition to nonprofit status failed to gain traction.</p>
<p>“That’s the decision that I had to make to really jumpstart what we consider to be, so far, a very successful initiative,” Meoli said in an April 16 phone interview.</p>
<p>The theater’s GoFundMe campaign, titled “Preserve a Community Cinema Born from Love,” warned in an April 14 email that “our beloved Cinelounge could fade to black for good” without reaching its financial goal. But Meoli clarified that people could continue donating after the deadline, adding that meeting even part of the goal would provide a good start over the next couple of months toward resolving the theater’s financial struggles.</p>

      <title>Tiburon Councilmember Nikfar misses yet another state financial report deadline</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-councilmember-nikfar-misses-yet-another-state-financial-report-deadline</link>
      <description>The failure to file reflects a pattern for Nikfar, who missed three disclosure deadlines August 2023 and November 2024 elections.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four Tiburon Town Council­members have disclosed economic interests totaling at least $2.84 million for 2024, while Councilmember Isaac Nikfar has once again failed to submit legally required financial reports by the state deadline.</p>
<p>Councilmember Jack Ryan leads with a minimum of $1.17 million in economic interests, followed by Mayor Holli Thier with at least $1 million. Councilmember Alice Fredericks reported at least $453,013, while Vice Mayor Jon Welner disclosed at least $210,001.</p>
<p>California law requires these annual economic-interest statements, known as Form 700, to be filed by April 1. The California Fair Political Practices Commission mandates that all elected officials and public employees “who (make) or (influence) governmental decisions” submit these disclosures.</p>
<p>The failure to file state-mandated financial disclosures for his office reflects a pattern for Nikfar, who missed two deadlines for campaign-finance disclosures related to the November 2024 election, most recently a semiannual report due Jan. 31. Nikfar also missed his initial campaign-fina...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Foundation for Reed Schools is asking parents to don their “boots and bling” for the May 10Reed Rodeo, a Western-themed night of dinner and dancing to help raise money for enrichment classes at the Reed Union School District’s three schools.</p>
<p>The event, set for 6 p.m. at Peacock Gap Golf Club in San Rafael, serves as the foundation’s final big push to meet its $2-million fundraising goal for the 2024-2025 school year, with most of that money going directly to the district to help support art, music, physical education, language and library programs.</p>
<p>Jen Feldman, the foundation’s director of marketing, communications and events, called the annual gala “a great way to bring the community together.”</p>
<p>“This is a way for parents to come together and to help raise money and to really instill what the foundation does into the parents that attend,” she said.</p>
<p>This year’s fundraising efforts also include an online auction, which runs May 1-11 and is open to both district families and the larger community. It will feature a variety of items available for bid, in...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Construction is targeted for spring 2026 because it will take up to a year to obtain one of the necessary parts for the upgrade.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sanitary District No. 5 of Marin will spend $3.3 million to rehabilitate its Cove Road pump station, with work set to begin in spring 2026.</p>
<p>The district board of directors unanimously approved separate contracts at its April 17 meeting: $2.84 million with Fort Bragg-based Fort Bragg Electric for the construction and $168,889 with San Rafael-based Nute Engineering for construction management. Both contracts include a 10% contingency. Funding will come from the district’s capital reserves, District Manager Tony Rubio said.</p>
<p>Construction is targeted for spring 2026 because it will take up to a year to obtain one of the necessary parts for the upgrade, the motor-control center, estimated to cost $628,000, he said.</p>
<p>The actual work to rehabilitate the station, located at the corner of Cove and Barn roads in Belvedere, will last three to four months.</p>
<p>Nute Engineering, which also designed the project, found that the station’s electrical switchgear and motor-control center exhibited “age-related conditions, which include difficulty in finding replacement part...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>“Border Surveillance: Places, People and Technology” features panels detailing technologies used to monitor border crossings — from aerostats and drones to fixed cameras and ground sensors.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Visitors to the Angel Island Immigration Museum can explore a new temporary exhibit examining border-surveillance technologythrough May 25, thanks to a collaboration with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>
<p>“Border Surveillance: Places, People and Technology,” which opened April 2 at the museum on Angel Island State Park in Tiburon, features panels detailing technologies used to monitor border crossings — from aerostats and drones to fixed cameras and ground sensors. The exhibit also explores emerging surveillance methods, including augmented reality and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Edward Tepporn, executive director of the Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation that oversees the museum, said that while the digital-privacy nonprofit developed the exhibit independently, he was proud the museum serves as its inaugural venue.</p>
<p>“Part of the interest in hosting it is that the work that we’ve done at the foundation, in collaboration with Angel Island State Park, over the past 40-plus years has been about lifting up the history of immigration through Angel Island, bu...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Aubrey O’Connor is the new Reed Elementary School principal, replacing Mary Niesyn, who is retiring.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A longtime teacher and administrator in the Mill Valley School District has been named the next principal at Reed Elementary School.</p>
<p>Aubrey O’Connor, the current principal at Park Elementary School, will join the Reed Union School District July 1, with a starting annual salary of $200,000. Her hiring was approved by a 4-0 vote of the district board at its April 15 meeting; the item was included in the district’s personnel report as part of the board’s consent agenda, reserved for bulk approval of items deemed noncontroversial. Board member Afsaneh Zolfaghari was absent.</p>
<p>O’Connor was chosen among seven applicants interviewed to replace Mary Niesyn, who is retiring after a 21-year career at the school that saw her serve as a second-grade teacher and assistant principal before assuming the top job in 2015.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“It’s fun,” Marsella, 43, says about Little League. “They play because they love it. The best part is seeing all the kids have a great time.”</p>
<p>Marsella says he appreciates the parental involvement in the league.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon Mayor Holli Thier will join the crowded 2026 contest to replace Damon Connolly in the California State Assembly.</p>
<p>Thier, who is in the first year of her third term on the Town Council, announced last week she intended to run for the District 12 seat, which covers all of Marin County and nearly half of Sonoma County, including Petaluma, Rohnert Park and Cotati.</p>
<p>Connolly, D-San Rafael, was elected in 2022 and has announced his campaign to replace President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, D-Healdsburg, in the state Senate, as McGuire terms out next year.</p>
<p>Thier confirmed her candidacy to The Ark in an April 11 email, citing issues such as the rising cost of living, insurance companies not writing policies for California homeowners and a need for “strong advocates … who can protect our residents against the dismantling of our democracy” with President Donald Trump in office for a second term.</p>

      <description>The theater owner's complaint says the operator of the Rafael, Sequoia and Mill Valley Film Fest is hurting his business.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cinelounge co-founder Christian Meoli is accusing the California Film Institute of “unfair and bullying tactics” for enforcing what he says are three-week exclusivity agreements with art house and specialty film distributors that prevent the downtown Tiburon theater from showing certain movies upon release.</p>
<p>Meoli on April 3 filed a claim with the Independent Theater Owners Coalition, an arm of the Cinema United trade organization, to end the exclusivity practices and is weighing his legal options, including potentially filing an antitrust claim.</p>
<p>The move came as Cinelounge’s nonprofit arm, theBelvedere Tiburon Film Society, abruptly launched a $500,000 fundraising campaign on April 14, saying in an email newsletter it needed to raise the cash by April 21 or the theater “could fade to black for good.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon has lifted its nearly eight-year moratorium on forming new utility-undergrounding districts and will contribute to some preliminary planning costs to help residents obtain accurate project estimates before deciding whether to bury their lines.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously April 2 to allow new districts to form, paving the way for Mar West Street neighbors to explore burying their electric infrastructure. The council also decided to help pay for the final engineering report for proposed projects, with the town’s contribution to be determined case by case.</p>
<p>Under the approved rules, property owners would reimburse Tiburon for its contribution if they vote to form the district and proceed with the project, but the town would lose its funding if residents vote against undergrounding.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Reed schools grad Samantha Riley won an invitation to the National Team Selection Camp.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Samantha Riley, a 15-year-old water polo athlete and former Reed Union School District student, has dreams of becoming an Olympian. Now she’s training to be one.</p>
<p>The Redwood High School freshman won a spot at the invitation-only National Team Selection Camp April 25-27 in Orange County after her Olympic Development Program age-group team placed seventh at the national championships last month. The camp will evaluate 75 athletes in her age group, with 16 advancing to compete in the international Pan American Games this summer.</p>
<p>Riley attended the selection camp in 2023 but has yet to compete in the games. Athletes at the camp will develop various water polo skills before participating in a tournament on the final day, she said.</p>
<p>She’s making a splash, capturing the attention of coaches and organizers. Riley won the Nick Johnson Inspiration Award during the Olympic Development Program national championships in Salt Lake City March 28-30. The award recognizes athletes who demonstrate inspirational teamwork in and out of the pool, Riley said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tiburon poet finds healing through verse</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-poet-finds-healing-through-verse</link>
      <description>Ashley Moyo uses the spoken word to process grief, identity and life as part of African diaspora.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ashley Moyowrote her first poem at age 9 for a school assignment about glasses. She continued using poetry throughout her education, including as a Model United Nations member in high school, when she began her speeches with poems rather than quotes or statistics.</p>
<p>“I saw that (poems) had a huge impact, like I could hold the crowd in that in those moments,” Moyo says.</p>
<p>The Tiburon resident says she began taking poetry seriously in 2018 during her senior year of high school after sharing one of her poems at an interactive theater show. The director reached out afterward and asked if she wanted to try slam poetry, a type of competition where poets perform original work before a live audience and judges.</p>
<p>Since then, Moyo, 25, has entered numerous competitions — and she’s racked up several wins, including three in 2022. She balances her passion for poetry with pursuing a nursing degree at College of Marin, saying she hopes to eventually merge art with health care as an art therapist.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Stanley Wong is leading growing after-school programs across Marin and the North Bay.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon resident Stanley Wong observes the eight kids gathered in a classroom at Valle­cito Elementary School in San Rafael on a recent Friday afternoon. The kids are there for an after-school chess class, and they’re learning about castling, the special move where the king and rook simultaneously move along the same rank to bring the rook into action while protecting the king.</p>
<p>The students raise their hands eagerly when they have questions and ideas, with some running up to the board to tell their instructor, Terra Linda resident Leo Maso, what they would do in each scenario.</p>
<p>Wong, the 19-year-old executive director ofMarinChess, says he enjoys seeing the students’ enthusiasm to learn the game, which he says teaches kids larger problem-solving skills, as well.</p>
<p>“You’re in a position right now, and you have to find your way to maneuver out of it, how to find yourself in the best position possible,” Wong says. “I think chess is a really great analogy for … all of that.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Born in Iran, Tiburon resident Paul Inalou moved to the U.S. at age 12 — though he lived in Japan for two years and played on his school's soccer team.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon resident Paul Inalou is having a midday kickaround with his three daughters at McKegney Green, as he says he’s getting his girls to fall in love with soccer.</p>
<p>Inalou, 49, Nikka, 10, Lenna, 8, and Adrina, 3, take turns playing goalkeeper as the others take shots at the net.</p>
<p>“They don’t want to go anywhere else today, just to come play,” Inalou says. Born in Iran, Inalou moved to the U.S. at age 12. His father, however, had to move to Japan for a work project for five years, and the rest of the family followed, with Inalou spending two years in the country and playing on his school’s soccer team.</p>]]></content:encoded>
