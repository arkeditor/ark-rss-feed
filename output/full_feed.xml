     <title>Candidates have through March 6 to enter federal, state, local races</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/candidates-have-through-march-6-to-enter-federal-state-local-races</link>
     <description>The filing period for the June 2 primary is open, and candidates can run for seats ranging from Congress to governor and local offices.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marin County’s filing period for the June 2 statewide direct primary is open, and candidates can run for seats ranging from Congress to governor and local offices.</p>
<p>The deadline is 5 p.m. March 6, extended to March 11 for any position where the incumbent has not filed.</p>
<p>The race for the District 12 state Assembly seat is likely to feature Tiburon Town Councilmember Holli Thier, who declared her candidacy last year. Those who have taken out papers but not yet filed include Marin County Supervisor Eric Lucan of Novato, Rohnert Park Councilmember Jackie Elward and Eryn Cervantes, a Republican San Quentin Rehabilitation Center officer. Corte Madera Town Councilmember Eli Beckman and Sebastopol resident Steve Schwartz have also announced candidacies.</p>
<p>All are seeking to replace Assembly­member Damon Connolly, D-San Rafael, who has taken out papers for the District 2 state Senate seat, where Healdsburg Democrat Mike McGuire is termed out and running for Congress in District 1; the seat is currently vacant due to the death of Rep. Doug LaMalfa. Tief Gibbs, secretary of the Marin County Republican Central Committee, has also taken out papers locally for the state Senate seat.</p>
<p>Incumbent Rep. Jared Huffman, a San Rafael Democrat, has filed for re-election in California’s 2nd Congressional District, which expanded after voters approved Proposition 50 redistricting in November. Marin resident Gregory Burgess, who has no party affiliation, has also filed, while Kevin Eisele, a Novato Democrat, has taken out papers.</p>
<p>Former Sausalito Mayor Janelle Kellman has taken out papers for lieutenant governor but not yet filed. Term-limited Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and state Treasurer Fiona Ma are seeking to swap jobs in November. Robert Howell, a longtime president of a cybersecurity equipment manufacturer, has taken out papers for insurance commissioner; incumbent Ricardo Lara is termed out.</p>
<p>Also termed out are Gov. Gavin Newsom and Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, who’s running to replace Newsom. The crowded field of Democrats is currently splitting voters in polls, putting the two Republicans in the top two spots to advance to November.</p>
<p>Several incumbents are seeking to retain their seats, including Secretary of State Shirley Weber, Controller Malia Cohen and Attorney General Rob Bonta.</p>
<p>For Marin seats, Shelly Scott has filed to seek re-election as county assessor-recorder-county clerk, with no challen...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>New Business: Marin Peak Physio opens in Strawberry with emphasis on movement, not machines</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/new-business-marin-peak-physio-opens-in-strawberry-with-emphasis-on-movement-not-machines</link>
     <description>Marin Peak Physio opened Jan. 3 and focuses on manual therapy, one-on-one interaction and movement education.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Physical therapist Adrian Carvalho says one of his most memorable clients was a woman in her 40s living with chronic pain.</p>
<p>“She had been to many clinics and she had injections and she tried pain pills,” Carvalho says. Nothing seemed to help. Carvalho and his team got to work.</p>
<p>“We did a bunch of manual therapy at first, hands-on approach,” he says. “And then we slowly started to incorporate exercise, which I think was one of the missing factors.”</p>
<p>Five years later, he says, the woman ran her first Olympic-distance triathlon. “She’s now a triathlete,” he says. “And this is someone who never exercised before.”</p>
<p>Carvalho says those results are what inspire him and his team at Marin Peak Physio, a new physical-therapy clinic that opened Jan. 3 on the Redwood Highway frontage road in Strawberry. Carvalho operates the business with co-founders David Atwood and Tim Drobnick. The three have worked together for 16 years at Golden Gate Physical Therapy on Bush Street in San Francisco.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A retired local anesthesiologist builds endurance by cross skating Blackie’s Pasture</title>

     <description>The retired anesthesiologist says he cross skates at Blackie’s Pasture weekly — and he&apos;s taken a few falls over the years.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Martin London pushes and lunges through Blackie’s Pasture on his cross skates Feb. 18. The specialized, all-terrain roller skates include 6-to-8-inch tires, bindings that wrap over regular shoes and brakes activated by leaning back. Cross skates are designed to simulate cross-country skiing on pavement or trails, but there’s one key difference, he says — no soft snow to break a fall.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to wipe out on these,” says London, 72. “You hit concrete.”</p>

     <title>Tiburon resident among nine killed in avalanche near Lake Tahoe</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-resident-among-eight-killed-in-avalanche-near-tahoe</link>
     <description>Families are “devastated beyond words” after nine people, including Tiburon&apos;s Kate Morse, died in the Feb. 17 avalanche outside Truckee.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated:2 minutes ago</p>
<p>Note: Published Feb. 19. Updated Feb. 22.Kate Morse, a 45-year-old Tiburon resident and biotech executive, was among nine people killed Feb. 17 when an avalanche struck a group of backcountry skiers near Castle Peak in Nevada County — the deadliest avalanche ever recorded in California and among the deadliest in U.S. history.</p>
<p>A mother of three, Morse was among eight close friends whose children ski for Sugar Bowl Academy, a competitive ski school near Donner Summit. The group was on a professionally guided Presidents Day weekend trip to remote huts northwest of Truckee, skiing back to the trailhead on the final morning when the slide struck at about 11:30 a.m.</p>
<p>The group had decided to cut the trip short and leave early due to worsening conditions, Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a Feb. 21 press conference.</p>
<p>All nine bodies were recovered from the mountain by Feb. 21 after weather had delayed the effort for days.</p>
<p>Morse, who grew up in Averill Park, New York, attended Williams College in Massachusetts and earned an MBA from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, where she met her husband, Eric Morse. They married in 2011.</p>
<p>“They bonded over their mutual love of the great outdoors, especially skiing,” friends Christine DeGennaro and Cat Gore wrote on theirGoFundMe page for the family. “When they settled in the San Francisco Bay Area, they took frequent trips to Eric’s parents’ home in Serene Lakes, and Sugar Bowl became their home mountain.”</p>
<p>The couple lived in Strawberry before purchasing their Tiburon home in 2015, the same year their first child was born. The two eldest, both daughters, compete for Sugar Bowl Academy.</p>
<p>“Kate was nothing short of an incredible mother and a bright spirit,” DeGennaro and Gore wrote.</p>
<p>The GoFundMe had raised $51,750 as of early Feb. 22, while a separate Meal Train had raised $58,961, with a daily meal-support calendar for the family booked through June 24.</p>
<p>Morse spent more than 20 years in the life-sciences industry. She most recently served as vice president of commercial strategy at Septerna, a South San Francisco-based biotechnology company, according to her LinkedIn profile. Before joining Septerna, she held senior roles at Genentech, where she worked in U.S. commercial sales and marketing from 2010 to 2018; Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical; Agios Pharmaceuticals; and Vir Biotechnology, where she rose ...</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Homeowner Marshall Miller wanted the penalty wiped out entirely for his project at 431 Golden Gate Ave., which finished 627 days past the city’s deadline, but the council voted unanimously Feb. 9 to cut the penalty by 299 days. That leaves him on the hook for 328 days of fines, amounting to $339,600.</p>
<p>The project — a major addition and remodel of a single-family home, including a new accessory dwelling unit, garage reconstruction and extensive site and landscape work — began under a previous construction-time-limit ordinance with retroactive, uncapped penalties. Large projects got 18 months to finish, with a possible six-month extension, and were fined up to $1,200 daily for overruns.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>One of Richardson Bay’s last anchor-outs mourns the loss of community</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/one-of-richardson-bay-s-last-anchor-outs-mourns-the-loss-of-community</link>
     <description>Liveaboard Chad Wycliffe struggles to find housing ashore while navigating state relocation rules and expired vouchers.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHEN CHAD WYCLIFFE looks out across Richardson Bay, he says he mostly feels bewilderment.</p>
<p>Sitting on the deck of the 45-foot Ingrid sailing boat he calls home, Wycliffe looks out over expanses of empty water. Five boats spread out over the bay bob in the chop where there once were hundreds. While many people on shore regarded the boats as a nuisance, to Wycliffe they meant home and community.</p>
<p>“There was a time when I could walk down the street and there wasn’t a person I couldn’t name by first name,” Wycliffe says, “Now, it’s almost like, where do I live?”</p>
<p>“Not having anyone here, I don’t see much joy in anything anymore,” he says.</p>
<p>Wycliffe’s boat, the Solar Wind, is one of the last liveaboard boats on Richardson Bay. After 40 years of battles and lawsuits, the Richardson Bay Regional Agency, which is responsible for managing the anchorage, has claimed victory in its fight against derelict boats anchored long-term on the bay.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Richardson Bay anchorage nearly cleared after decades of conflict, cleanup and court battles</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/richardson-bay-anchorage-nearly-cleared-after-decades-of-conflict-cleanup-and-court-battles</link>
     <description>The Richardson Bay Regional Agency is claiming victory in its fight to clear the anchorage of derelict vessels.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ten years ago, the Richardson Bay anchorage was a junkyard filled with derelict boats: chopped-up sailboats without masts, cutters piled with batteries, fuel tanks, boats parts and old appliances and rusted tugboats with lines dripping with seaweed. Boats routinely sank, leaking toxins into the bay or slipped anchor in storms. The Richardson Bay Regional Agency spent hundreds of thousands of tax dollars to abate the worst of them, but more arrived each day.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and the anchorage is nearly unrecognizable. Where once there were more than 240 liveaboard boats housing 150 people, only five boats remain. The view is open water, birds and sky, with clear sailing in every direction.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing to see the progress we have made to improve the conditions on the water,” Richardson Bay Regional Agency board chair and Tiburon Town Councilmember Jack Ryan said in a statement on the agency’s website. “Without all these boats on the water, everyone has full access to Richardson Bay, and, critically, we are protecting the ecosystem that sustains this wonderful place.”</p>
<p>After 40 years of battles, lawsuits and millions of dollars spent, the Richardson Bay Regional Agency is claiming victory in its fight to clear the anchorage of derelict vessels.</p>
<p>Environmentalists are celebrating a cleaner bay where ecologically vital eelgrass can recover and thrive. Sunken debris, the remnants of 70 years of anchorage living, is being hauled up off the bay floor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere revises housing plan again, expects quick certification</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-revises-housing-plan-again-expects-quick-certification</link>
     <description>Sacramento requested one additional legal clause to fully satisfy state requirements for how cities justify their housing sites.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere made a minor tweak to its state-mandated housing plan last week that city officials say should end years of back-and-forth with Sacramento and secure certification within weeks — though the new language doesn’t quite align with recent statements from the landowner whose properties anchor the plan.</p>
<p>The City Council unanimously approved the revision to its 2023-2031 housing element Feb. 9 after the California Department of Housing and Community Development requested one additional legal clause to fully satisfy state requirements for how cities justify their housing sites.</p>
<p>Belvedere had sent the latest version for 60-day review Dec. 11, meaning the city was poised to receive formal findings by Feb. 9. However, Planning and Building Director Rebecca Markwick said that after staff met directly with state officials, the city agreed to rescind the Dec. 11 submittal, ending the risk of yet another rejection. With the council’s Feb. 9 revision in place, she resubmitted the updated version to the state housing agency Feb. 10.</p>
<p>“They should have a (findings) letter to us within a few weeks and will not use the full 60 days that they are allowed to,” Markwick said by email.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Bel Aire school will scale back partnership with diversity camp</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/bel-aire-school-will-scale-back-partnership-with-diversity-camp</link>
     <description>Participation will be limited to about 30 fourth-grade students instead of being open to any fourth grader who wants to go.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bel Aire Elementary School will continue its long-standing partnership with The Mosaic Project overnight camp next year, though participation will be limited to about 30 fourth-grade students instead of being open to any fourth grader who wants to go.</p>
<p>The Feb. 10 directive from the Reed Union School District board to maintain a scaled-down partnership with the weeklong diversity camp came after staff recommended eliminating participation in the program entirely beginning in the 2026-2027 school year. Staff has proposed replacing the camp with a campus-wide, yearlong social-emotional learning program that would include expanded counseling services, a wellness week event, service-learning opportunities and more.</p>
<p>Board members said they supported the model being developed by staff but were reluctant to fully eliminate participation in The Mosaic Project given positive feedback from families whose kids have attended in the past. The staff plan didn’t appear to offer an equivalent experience to the camp, which brings kids from varied backgrounds together in Felton, about seven miles north of Santa Cruz, to learn about diversity, empathy and conflict resolution, they said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Survey drives Belvedere lane repairs, wins council backing</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/survey-drives-belvedere-lane-repairs-wins-council-backing</link>
     <description>Projects include structural fixes, tree work, improved safety features and accessibility upgrades.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere’s historic walking lanes could soon have their first official map for residents, while a detailed survey is already steering repairs to failing stairs, missing signs and deteriorating railings on the hillside paths.</p>
<p>The Parks, Open Spaces and Lanes Committee presented its annual report to the City Council on Feb. 9, outlining a year of survey work that produced a comprehensive look at the city’s 29 historically mapped lanes — and a tracking tool that’s helping staff prioritize safety improvements.</p>
<p>Chair Charlie Harrington said the committee has focused its efforts after years of what Mayor Sally Wilkinson described as scattered priorities.</p>
<p>“In the past, it used to be loosey-goosey, wanting a million things,” Wilkinson said. “And this idea of staying very focused on a few projects has been really successful.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Competing designs for playground leave Strawberry Rec board wanting more answers</title>

     <description>Members are eyeing a giant strawberry for their new playground — but they need more information before deciding which company will build it.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strawberry Recreation District board members are eyeing a giant strawberry for their new playground — but they need more information before deciding which company will build it.</p>
<p>The board on Feb. 10 heard updated presentations from Kompan and GameTime, the two firms competing for the project. Board members want cost estimates that include both custom strawberry features and off-the-shelf equipment options.</p>
<p>District General Manager Nancy Shapiro said the board also needs updated engineering information about drainage and retaining walls at the site. A final decision won’t come until April “at the earliest,” she said.</p>
<p>The playground will replace Reggie Park, a play area that was removed in 2023 to make way for pickleball and basketball courts. The new playground will be built off Belvedere Drive on a patch of grass between the tennis courts and baseball fields.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A motion designer and his dog enjoy walks in Tiburon parks</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-motion-designer-and-his-dog-enjoy-walks-in-tiburon-parks</link>
     <description>Tyson Dale has worked on broadcast and internal communications and using stop-motion, puppetry and “all animation-related things.”</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a rainy day along the Old Rail Trail near South of the Knoll Park, San Rafael resident Tyson Dale is wrapping up a lunchtime walk with his dog, Phoebe.</p>
<p>Dale brought the 2-year-old cockapoo to the Richardson Bay Lineal Park on Feb. 11 because “it’s the best place to take my dog.”</p>
<p>“She’s more energy than I thought she was going to be, but she’s great,” Dale says of Phoebe, his first dog.</p>
<p>Dale, who moved to Marin from San Francisco eight months ago, says his favorite part about dog ownership is their walks together when he’s not working as a motion designer. He says he enjoys taking her out along Tiburon’s paths and trails, which gives her a chance to chase balls around when she’s allowed to.</p>

     <title>Martin Conrad Carr</title>

     <description>Martin Conrad Carr died Feb. 9, a month before his 92nd birthday, in his home in Belvedere.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Martin Conrad Carr, MD (b. 1934) was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, by loving parents, Helen and Louis Carr. He attended Stuyvesant High School and University of Vermont, where he majored in history, played varsity basketball, and fell in love with Jeanette Rubinstein. After marrying, graduating from New York University medical school (under the inspirational mentorship of Dr. Lewis Thomas), and completing residency at the Brooklyn Jewish Hospital, he received an offer from UCSF Medical School and moved his young family away from the cold winters of New York to California.</p>
<p>In 1968, following a two-year hiatus in Wyoming where he had been drafted as a doctor into the Air Force, Jeanette, Marty and their three children returned to Marin, this time to Belvedere, five houses down from Belvedere School, where they would continue to live for some 55 years. Years later, he would leave the academic world to open a private medical practice, and for more than 40 years he was a respected and well-appreciated San Francisco gynecologist. A student of history, Marty cared deeply about the well-being of the United States and the survival, too, of Israel.</p>
<p>Marty was a dedicated husband to Jeanette, the love of his life, and a proud father to Joel Carr, Valerie Zakovitch and Linda Carr, father-in-law to Joan Diengott, Yair Zakovitch and Steve Tornallyay, grandfather to six beautiful grandchildren and great-grandfather to three. He was a keen investor in the stock market and reader of the Wall Street Journal, an avid golfer, lover of iced tea, pistachios and all sorts of baked goods. He was a fan of Jane Austen and of early Hollywood movies, a life-long student of history and politics, and an expert, in particular, on American and 20th Century European history.</p>
<p>Marty was a man of principle and firm opinions, which he expressed fervently. He will be remembered as both a romantic and a realist, cautious in life (if adventuresome in stocks) and adoring of his wife. He was an optimist, saying, “Things tend to work out.” On February 9, a month before his 92nd birthday, Marty died in his home in Belvedere, surrounded by his beloved family, grateful for the life he lived.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon unveils conceptual designs for parks upgrades</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-wants-feedback-on-early-conceptual-designs-for-parks</link>
     <description>Tiburon is seeking community feedback through Feb. 19 on preliminary designs for four neighborhood parks.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early concepts to upgrade four Tiburon parks include basketball, beach volleyball and an outdoor lounge near McKegney Green, accessible play areas at Cypress Hollow Park, nature-based features at Belveron Mini Park and a new walking trail and seating at the Bel Aire play area.</p>
<p>The town’s Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission is set to discuss the concepts at a special 6 p.m. Feb. 23 meeting at Town Hall. Residents cansubmit feedback onlinethrough tomorrow, Feb. 19, or during the meeting.</p>
<p>The town last year hired Mill Valley-based RHAA Landscape Architecture and Planning to create the concepts for the former sanitation ponds site near McKegney Green and for Belveron Mini Park, with Santa Rosa-based Carlile Macy Inc. designing concepts for Cypress Hollow Park and the Bel Aire play area.</p>
<p>The preliminary designs, unveiled Feb. 10, are based on resident feedback and input from town officials, including the parks commission and Town Council.</p>
<p>Public Works Engineering Manager David Eshoo said designers will use commission and community feedback to revise plans before presenting them to the Town Council on March 18. Councilmembers will then review and provide direction before final construction documents are prepared.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Mallard Pointe gets time extension, but Belvedere rule on affordable housing stands</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/mallard-pointe-gets-time-extension-but-belvedere-rule-on-affordable-housing-stands</link>
     <description>Developer issues notices to vacate, with work targeted to start in August.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belvedere Planning Commission granted the Mallard Pointe developer a one-year extension and longer demolition window but refused to weaken the city’s strongest tool for ensuring four affordable apartments get built: requiring those units receive certificates of occupancy before or at the same time as any market-rate homes.</p>
<p>The 40-unit project at 1-22 Mallard Road, from Mill Valley-based Thompson Dorfman Partners LLC as Mallard Pointe 1951 LLC, would replace 22 existing apartments with a mix of an apartment building, townhomes, duplexes and single-family homes. Four apartments must be affordable to low- and very low-income households under state law.</p>
<p>Commissioners extended the design review approval deadline from March 19, 2026, to March 19, 2027, with corresponding extensions for later milestones. They also lengthened the demolition window from 45 to 75 days, measured from permit issuance rather than when demolition equipment appears on site.</p>
<p>But they rejected developer requests to allow market-rate units in phase one to receive occupancy permits before the apartment building containing affordable units is complete — the central dispute of the evening.</p>
<p>Four days after the commission’s approval, principal Bruce Dorfman said in a Feb. 6 email that residents have been issued notice that relocation will be required within 180 days, targeting an August construction start that will include demolition, bulkhead replacement and installation of new utilities, roadways and sidewalks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Tiburon resident Mike Ghaffary replaces Sherry Wangenheim, who resigned in December with one year left on her term.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A parent with a background in finance and a demonstrated commitment to civic service won an interim seat on the Reed Union School District board of trustees, beating out four other candidates.</p>
<p>Tiburon resident Mike Ghaffary was appointed to fill the vacancy by a 4-0 vote at a special Feb. 6 meeting.</p>
<p>He’ll replace Sherry Wangenheim, who resigned in December with one year left on her term. Wangenheim, a board member since 2017, is moving to London with her family later this year.</p>
<p>Ghaffary was set to be sworn in at the board’s Feb. 10 meeting, held after The Ark’s press deadline. He will serve the remainder of Wangenheim’s term through early December. In a Feb. 8 interview, he said he plans to run in the Nov. 3 general election to retain the seat for a full four-year term.</p>
<p>His appointment expands his local public-service commitments. Ghaffary also serves on the Tiburon Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission, a seat he has held since last March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Neighbors press for action as Belvedere again extends wall deadline</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/neighbors-press-for-action-as-belvedere-again-extends-wall-deadline</link>
     <description>Unpermitted hillside work by a prior owner still remains after six years.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six years after a previous homeowner built an illegal retaining wall at 105 Golden Gate Ave., the Belvedere Planning Commission granted another extension to current owner Tim Kasta to fix it — this time with deadlines designed to force action.</p>
<p>The commission voted 4-0 Feb. 2 to extend design review approval for a residential project that includes demolishing and rebuilding the unpermitted wall built in 2020. Vice Chair Jenna Watson recused herself due to living within 500 feet of the property.</p>
<p>This marks the third extension for the project. Staff administratively granted a one-year extension in September 2024 without commission review. The commission approved another extension in September 2025 but continued the item to allow Kasta time to submit a detailed reconstruction plan for the retaining wall.</p>
<p>The extension moves the design review expiration to Feb. 2, 2027, but commissioners added two conditions intended to accelerate the work: Kasta must apply for a building permit by July 2 and plant four coast live oaks to replace trees the previous owner removed without approval.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belveron East resident must rethink home project after pushback on second story</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belveron-east-resident-must-rethink-home-project-after-pushback-on-second-story</link>
     <description>62 neighbors signed a petition opposing the project.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Belveron East homeowner must rethink plans for a second-story addition on a corner lot after 62 neighbors signed a petition opposing the project in a neighborhood where most homes are single-story.</p>
<p>The Tiburon Design Review Board voted 4-0 at its Jan. 29 meeting, with member Jim O’Dorisio absent, to continue discussion on the proposed project at 68 Mercury Ave. They told owner Reide Baxter to return with a design that evens out the massing of the home, with member Suzanne Kim saying the current design “looks unbalanced.”</p>
<p>The petition opposed Baxter’s plan to add about 1,342 square feet onto his existing 1,250-square-foot home, including creating a 755-square-foot second floor that would have two bedrooms, a bathroom and a study. The neighbors’ letter cited the design’s “adverse impacts on views and neighborhood aesthetics” and called for Baxter to remove the second story.</p>
<p>Board members were split on whether a second story could work — Kim and colleague Phoebe Holscher said they were open to it, Chair Bryan Chong said he couldn’t support a two-story and Vice Chair Alex Rosner said he “would need a lot of convincing” to approve it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Board members were split on whether they’d support a second story in the neighborhood, though they agreed a new design with reduced massing was needed. (Wright Architecture)</media:description>
