     <title>Tiburon plans $6.43 mil in projects</title>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon plans to spend $6.43 million on capital-improvement projects in the 2025-2026 fiscal year, with about $1.06 million earmarked for parks improvements as the town begins implementing its long-term vision for parks, recreation and open spaces.</p>
<p>Among the projects are fixing Tiburon’s steps, lanes and paths; replacing the bridge along the Old Rail Trail toward downtown Tiburon; adding wayfinding signs throughout the town; rehabbing Lyford Tower’s roof; and an early $200,000 commitment toward overall parks amenities and improvements.</p>
<p>The Planning Commission reviewed the capital-improvement program May 28 and voted 3-0 to find it conforms with Tiburon’s general plan. Chair Kathleen Defever and Vice Chair Daniel Amir were absent.</p>
<p>The Town Council will review the program tonight, June 4, as part of the wider budget review for the new fiscal year, which starts July 1. The council is expected to adopt the budget, including capital projects, June 18.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>Caltrans plans to create bikeways on the north and south sides of Tiburon Boulevard as part of its 2026 repaving and rehabilitation project that extends from Mill Valley to downtown Paradise Drive. The blue segments represent Class-2 bike lanes, or marked on-road lanes alongside traffic that don’t have a physical barrier; the red segments are Class-4 separated bikeways, which are also on the roadway but protected from traffic; and the gold segment is a Class-1 bike path, which is away from the road, like the Old Rail Trail.

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon’s top sustainability official says she believes the town is still on track to meet its ambitious goal of reducing emissions to 50% below 1990 levels, but residents will need to pivot away from gas-powered vehicles and appliances.</p>
<p>Grace Ledwith, the shared climate action and sustainability coordinator for Tiburon and Mill Valley, delivered her annual update on Tiburon’s Climate Action Plan at the Town Council’s May 21 meeting.</p>
<p>The 126-page plan, adopted in September 2022, outlines strategies, time frames, staffing resources, greenhouse-gas reductions and key metrics with its emission-reduction goal — stronger than the 40% reduction set by the state in 2016. That will require slashing 21,000 metric tons of carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Ledwith said two of the big actions that can help Tiburon meet its goal are “really getting folks out of their single-occupancy gas-powered vehicles” and having people switch from gas- to electric-powered appliances.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon police to stick with detective role after trial run</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-police-to-stick-with-detective-role-after-trial-run</link>
     <description>“We’ve had great success solving three or four major cases,” Police Chief Michelle Jean said.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Police Department has officially resurrected its long-vacant detective role after a six-month trial in which the sergeant serving in the position helped make arrests in a robbery case of CVS/pharmacy and a serial shoplifting case at Nugget Market, among others, officials say.</p>
<p>Sgt. Rob Law will stay in the role indefinitely, though it will remain a specialty assignment rather than a permanent position within the force, Capt. Jarrod Yee said in an email. Law will retain his position as sergeant, one of the department’s four, while continuing to earn special assignment pay of $315 per month, or $3,780 per year, which he has been receiving since he took on the role in January.</p>
<p>“We’ve had great success solving three or four major cases,” Police Chief Michelle Jean said at a May 20 meeting of her Citizens Advisory Panel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bel Aire Elementary School will not participate in The Mosaic Project this fall, ending a 16-year partnership with the diversity camp program that costs the school district more than $100,000 annually.</p>
<p>The decision has divided the school community, with dozens of parents and community members packing a contentious May 29 meeting to debate the four-day camp program for fourth graders.</p>
<p>The Mosaic Project gathers students from schools across the Bay Area for what the nonprofit describes as an effort to “bring together students from diverse backgrounds to reduce prejudice and promote peace,” according to a May 4 Reed Union School District newsletter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Court: Belvedere must redo $300k construction-penalty decision</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/court-belvedere-must-redo-300k-construction-penalty-decision</link>
     <description>The court found that the Belvedere’s decision-making process lacked sufficient factual findings to justify upholding the maximum penalty.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Marin Superior Court judge has ordered the Belvedere City Council to reconsider its decision to impose a $300,000 construction time-limit penalty on the owner of a luxury home-remodel project, ruling that its findings were inadequate to support the fine.</p>
<p>Judge Andrew E. Sweet issued the ruling May 27 in the case involving 339 Golden Gate Ave. homeowners David and Julie Flaherty, who sued the city in October 2022 as Golden Gate Belvedere LLC. The court found that the Belvedere’s decision-making process lacked sufficient factual findings to justify upholding the maximum penalty and remanded the matter back to the council while retaining jurisdiction over the case.</p>
<p>“The lack of any subfindings leaves fundamental questions about the basis for the city’s decision unanswered,” Sweet wrote in his 23-page ruling. “The court is at a loss as to how to test the city’s findings against the evidence, given that the findings provide no information about what evidence played a role in the city’s decision.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Police Department is testing artificial intelligence software that converts body camera footage into police reports and exploring a second system to track officer performance.</p>
<p>Last month, the department activated a 90-day free trial of Barricade AI, software developed by a Mountain View company that analyzes camera footage and automatically generates police reports similar to how ChatGPT processes text, according to a presentation at the chief’s Citizens Advisory Panel meeting May 20.</p>
<p>Seven full-time officers are now using Barricade AI, which analyzes officer movements, incident timing and location data from body-cam and dash-cam footage. The software then creates narrative reports that officers must review and approve before filing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Former Citizen of the Year Emeritus Vera Gertler was crucial member of GreenTeam</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/former-citizen-of-the-year-emeritus-vera-gertler-was-crucial-member-of-greenteam</link>
     <description>Longtime Belvedere resident Vera Gertler died May 14 in San Francisco following an illness.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Longtime Belvedere resident Vera Gertler, who was honored as the city’s Citizen of the Year Emeritus in 2013 for her role in organizing the volunteer effort to beautify the medians along Tiburon Boulevard, died May 14 in San Francisco following an illness. She was 91.</p>
<p>Gertler, who lived in Belvedere for more than two decades, was a “super force” and critical in the early days of the Tiburon Peninsula GreenTeam and one of its predecessor organizations, the Beautify Tiburon Boulevard Committee, GreenTeam member Jerry Riessen said. The beautification committee was founded in 1996 with the goal of restoring boulevard medians to their 1976 state, when Caltrans had planted red photinia, white oleander and blue rosemary to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial.</p>
<p>“All of our meetings were at her house, and that’s where we organized ourselves,” Riessen said, adding that he has “very fond and great appreciation for all of her hard work.”</p>
<p>Gertler spent nine years, from July 2007 to June 2016, as Belvedere’s representative on the Marin County Commission on Aging, the advisory council that advocates on behalf of older adults to the Marin Board of Supervisors. During her tenure on the commission, Gertler served on the housing-and-transportation and planning-and-communications committees, said Gary Lara, an administrative assistant with the Marin County Health and Human Services Department and the staff liaison to the commission.</p>
<p>Gertler was born Vera Lutomirski on June 23, 1933, in Milan, Italy, to Simon Lutomirski and Gerda Boehm. She was the second of four children, born after brother Ernesto and before sisters Gabriella and Eva.</p>
<p>Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother took her and her sisters to Portugal before settling in Zurich, Switzerland, after escaping the Holocaust. During World War II, Boehm started a business sending out care packages with food, clothing and blankets to prisoners in concentration camps.</p>
<p>Gertler went on to receive a nursing degree in Geneva. Son Peter Gertler of Oakland said Gertler originally wanted to be an interior designer but was dissuaded by her own mom, who said it wasn’t a job for women.</p>
<p>However, nursing proved to be a good fit, he said.</p>
<p>“She was a natural at it because she loved to take care of people,” Peter said. “That was her sort of M.O., you know, even later in life.”</p>
<p>Gertler used her language skills — in addition to English, she was fluent in German, Fre...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have space on your calendar to be involved in an organization, you might consider joining the Marin chapter of the California Native Plant Society. The organization has a plethora of activities and learning experiences in and around the county’s amazing native-plant communities. Visitcnpsmarin.orgto learn more.</p>
<p>The monthly chapter meeting is at 7:30 p.m. June 9 via Zoom, featuring Meg Marriott, a wildlife biologist with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Marriott will talk about Marin Islands National Wildlife Refuge, an unpopulated reserve that serves as the largest heron and egret rookery in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>While the islands are not open to the public, volunteers can participate in stewardship activities. Participants take a motorboat from Loch Lomond in San Rafael to work on conservation tasks. This sounds like so much fun; I don’t qualify, as I clomp around on my walking stick, but you might.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Native American food dishes, interactive exhibits and a drum troupe powwow will be part of Tiburon’s newest cultural celebration coming to Zelinsky Park.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Native American food dishes, interactive exhibits and a drum troupe powwow will be part of Tiburon’s newest cultural celebration coming to Zelinsky Park, tentatively set for June 21, the day before the town’s fifth annual Juneteenth festival on lower Main Street.</p>
<p>The Town Council approved nearly $20,000 in funding for both events, voting 4-0-1 to grant $6,000 for the Native American heritage festival and $13,497 for Juneteenth; Vice Mayor Jon Welner abstained over ballooning cost concerns for the latter event. Earlier in the evening, the Diversity Inclusion Task Force recommended approval of the funding in 8-0 vote, with one vacancy and at-large appointee Nooshin Navidi Latour absent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>Caltrans plans to create bikeways on the north and south sides of Tiburon Boulevard as part of its 2026 repaving and rehabilitation project that extends from Mill Valley to Tiburon’s downtown Paradise Drive. The blue segments represent Class-2 bike lanes, or marked on-road lanes alongside traffic that don’t have a physical barrier; the red segments are Class-4 separated bikeways, which are also on the roadway but protected from traffic; and the gold segment is a Class-1 bike path, which is away from the road, like the Old Rail Trail.

     <media:description>The Belvedere-Tiburon Landmarks Society’s Art &amp; Garden Center in Tiburon is a popular wedding venue, but the nonprofit historical society was operating without a permit for amplified music for nearly three decades. Neighbors partially won an appeal of the new permit, requiring third-party monitoring to ensure decibel levels don’t exceed 60 at the property line.

     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-district-honors-teachers-staff-at-end-of-year-ceremony</link>
     <description>First-grade teacher Patty Ryan was named the Reed Union School District’s Teacher of the Year for 2024-2025.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reed Elementary School first-grade teacher Patty Ryan is known among her colleagues as humble, soft-spoken and compassionate, said Principal Mary Niesyn.</p>
<p>Ryan already has 25 years of teaching at Reed under her belt but is hoping for enough to become a “grand-teacher,” Niesyn said, which means having a student in her class who is the child of a former student.</p>
<p>For her efforts, Ryan was named the Reed Union School District’s Teacher of the Year for 2024-2025. She was one of more than a dozen teachers, classified staff and retirees honored at the district’s year-end Celebration of Education, which was held May 21 at St. Stephen’s Episcopal Church in Belvedere.</p>]]></content:encoded>
