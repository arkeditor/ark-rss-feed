     <title>Tiburon Peninsula voters back Prop. 50 to redraw California congressional districts for Democrats</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-peninsula-voters-back-prop-50-to-redraw-california-congressional-districts-for-democrats</link>
     <description>Some 74.9% of Tiburon voters supported the proposition, compared with 66.3% of Belvedere voters, as of 10:45 p.m. Nov. 4.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated:29 minutes ago</p>
<p>Tiburon Peninsula voters joined the rest of California in overwhelmingly approving efforts to temporarily redraw the state’s U.S. House districts in favor of Democrats. The measure seeks to counter Republican gerrymandering in Texas and other states.</p>
<p>Proposition 50 keeps the peninsula in the 2nd Congressional District but dramatically expands its boundaries to include Republican strongholds near the Oregon border. The measure had 63.8% statewide support as of midmorning Nov. 5, with 80.6% of Marin voters backing the initiative.</p>
<p>The Associated Press called the election shortly after polls closed Nov. 4.</p>
<p>Some 74.9% of Tiburon voters supported the proposition, compared with 66.3% of Belvedere voters, as of 10:45 p.m. Nov. 4. A precinct covering unincorporated areas representing all of unincorporated Tiburon and southern Strawberry has 77.8% of voters backing the initiative.</p>
<p>Statewide turnout was about 35% compared with 47% for Marin and the unincorporated peninsula, 46% for Belvedere and 45% for Tiburon.</p>
<p>Marin’s next results update is scheduled for no later than 5 p.m. Nov. 7, officials said. Results will be certified Dec. 2.</p>
<p>The measure was the only item on the ballot for peninsula voters. It creates opportunities for Democrats to gain up to five congressional seats statewide as part of the Election Rigging Response Act, the law Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in August that led to the ballot initiative in response to redistricting in Texas that would give Republicans an advantage in the 2026 midterm elections.</p>
<p>Sacramento-based Redistricting Partners, the consultant hired by congressional Democrats, drew the maps, which will be in effect for 2026. They’ll remain in place for the 2028 and 2030 elections before reverting to census-based lines drawn by California’s independent Citizen Redistricting Commission.</p>
<p>The California Republican Party and others filed a lawsuit Nov. 5 arguing the new maps are unconstitutional. They allege the maps were drawn to increase the voting power of a racial group, specifically Hispanic voters.</p>
<p>Proposition 50, which does not impact state Assembly or Senate districts, also includes language calling on Congress to pass federal legislation requiring the use of independent nonpartisan redistricting commissions nationwide.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, a San Rafael Democrat who has represented the 2nd District since 2013 and has expres...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tartine bakery sets sights on spring debut at Strawberry Village</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tartine-bakery-sets-sights-on-spring-debut-at-strawberry-village</link>
     <description>Construction was to begin before year’s end, according to Tartine CEO Dar Vasseghi.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated:28 minutes ago</p>
<p>Award-winning bakery Tartine is targeting a spring opening for its long-awaited Strawberry Village shopping center expansion, with construction to begin before year’s end, according to CEO Dar Vasseghi.</p>
<p>Tartine announced in March that it had chosen Strawberry for its first North Bay location, meaning residents will no long­er have to drive into San Francisco — or brave the notorious hourlong lines — for the bakery’s acclaimed sourdough, pastries and lunch items including seasonal quiches, omelets, smoked salmon and avocado tartines and hearty salads.</p>
<p>While representatives for Edens, the real-estate developer that owns the center, initially said the bakery would open in 2025, Vasseghi said last week the new target date is spring 2026, though he couldn’t provide more specifics.</p>
<p>Tartine, which has two San Francisco locations and six each in Los Angeles and Seoul, South Korea, will occupy 3,091 square feet across two long-vacant storefronts in the same cluster as Safeway, Calico Corners and High Tech Burrito, and across from Rims & Goggles.</p>
<p>The space will blend with the rest of the shopping center, Vasseghi said. San Francisco firm Studio BBA designed the space to incorporate the shopping center’s Mediterranean aesthetic with a large, open layout and high ceilings. Customers will be able to watch the bakers work.</p>
<p>The Marin location marks a return to Tartine’s roots: Husband-and-wife team Chad Robertson and Liz Prueitt first honed their craft with Wood-Fire Baking in Point Reyes, then launched Bay Village Breads in Mill Valley in 1999. They left Mill Valley for San Francisco in 2002 to open their first Tartine location in the city’s Mission district, where long lines formed each morning as customers reserved bread three days ahead.</p>
<p>In 2008, they won the James Beard Foundation Award as the best pastry chefs in America, and Bon Appétit magazine called Tartine “America’s most influential bakery” in 2017.</p>
<p>Vasseghi said he believes the Strawberry Village location will be a popular one.</p>
<p>“I think that the quality of the product is something people will welcome,” he said. “I think a warm environment where they can come and hang out and enjoy their product, they will welcome.”</p>

     <title>Marin restores key flood pump after months of setbacks from supply chain</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/marin-restores-key-flood-pump-after-months-of-setbacks-from-supply-chain</link>
     <description>The first of the season’s king tides, which can cause roadway flooding in the area, was expected today, Nov. 5, alongside a 90% chance of rain.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>International supply-chain delays kept a critical Strawberry pump station offline for months, raising concerns about contingency plans amid extreme tidal events and the approaching rainy season, but the refurbished equipment finally returned to service last week.</p>
<p>Parts for the Strawberry Circle pump station arrived from Sweden Oct. 29 after a summer-long wait. Marin County senior civil engineer Hannah Lee, a staff liaison to the advisory board, confirmed the pump returned to service Oct. 31. The first of the season’s king tides, which can cause roadway flooding in the area, is expected today, Nov. 5, alongside a 90% chance of rain.</p>
<p>The delays were discussed Oct. 28 at a Marin Flood Control Zone 4 advisory board meeting, alongside updates on a restoration project for the East and West creeks and a study to address flooding at Greenwood Cove Drive. No formal votes were taken.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon arts commission turns to parks for feedback on street-sign exhibit</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-arts-commission-turns-to-parks-for-feedback-on-street-sign-exhibit</link>
     <description>Los Angeles artist Scott Froschauer&apos;s public-art proposal will go before the parks board Nov. 18.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After months of tweaking a proposal for public-art street signs that say “soar” instead of “stop” and “you are amazing” instead of “do not enter,” the Tiburon Heritage and Arts Commission is turning to the town’s parks board for input on whether the installation should move forward.</p>
<p>Commissioners voted unanimously at their Oct. 28 meeting to ask the Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission for feedback on Los Angeles-based artist Scott Froschauer’s “The Word on the Street” exhibit, which would place 10 signs in Zelinsky, South of the Knoll, Cypress Hollow and Teather parks.</p>
<p>The parks board is expected to take a look at the project at its Nov. 18 meeting.</p>
<p>“It is, after all, their domain: the parks,” arts commission Chair Arjun Gupta said. “They know it well, they know what goes in and what comes out, and I’d love to hear from them what their thoughts are before we make any further moves on this project.”</p>
<p>If the arts board decides to back the project after weighing the parks commission’s feedback, it would return to the parks board for a formal recommendation and ultimately to the Town Council for final approval.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Cinelounge Tiburon plans to bring vertical movies to big screen</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/cinelounge-tiburon-plans-to-bring-vertical-movies-to-big-screen</link>
     <description>Submissions for the inaugural Marin Vertical Film Festival opened Nov. 4 and run through June, with the festival scheduled for next October.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Movies made for smartphones will fill a movie-theater screen in Tiburon next fall when Cinelounge hosts the inaugural Marin Vertical Film Festival.</p>
<p>Christian and Camilla Meoli, who own the downtown theater and live in town, have created the festival to showcase films shot in the vertical 9:16 aspect ratio designed for mobile devices. Submissions were set to open Nov. 4, after The Ark’s press time, viafilmfreeway.com. They’ll close in June 2026, and the festival is scheduled for Oct. 1-5, 2026.</p>
<p>Christian Meoli says the vertical-film festival is the first of five or six the theater, at 40 Main St., hopes to host next year. He says his goal is to bring the event to theaters across Marin.</p>
<p>“It will be a film festival that really embraces all the towns in Marin and really showcases a tremendous amount of new and young filmmakers, which is the point,” he says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon resident looks to assess well-being with ‘vitality index’</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-resident-looks-to-assess-well-being-with-vitality-index</link>
     <description>Factors can be anything from how a person perceives their relationships with others and how healthy they feel to their environmental stewardship or creative pursuits.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Tiburon resident Jim Lavelle thinks about living well, he remembers his grandmother Mary.</p>
<p>She built a home in Belvedere in 1951 and lived to be 99 years old. As health-conscious eater and keen fitness practitioner, she worked out to videos made by fitness pioneer Jack LaLanne and swam at her local YWCA well into her 80s.</p>
<p>She inspired Lavelle, now 74, to pursue health — something he says has become easier with advances in modern science.</p>
<p>“But, on the other hand, there’s a difference between living a long time and living your best life for as long as you can — because you can be healthy and still be miserable,” the Tiburon resident says.</p>
<p>That distinction led Lavelle to create the Vitality Index and Rating, a 100-point scale on which people can determine their vitality score by identifying the 10 most important traits or factors in their life and scoring each from one to 10. Those scores are added up for an overall rating.</p>
<p>Factors can be anything from how a person perceives their relationships with others and how healthy they feel to their environmental stewardship or creative pursuits, Lavelle says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sebastian Rivas has built a successful career in real-estate investing, but he says he’s ready for a change.</p>
<p>“I want to be a cop,” says Rivas, a Tiburon resident who was walking his dogs, Rodeo and Farallon, at Shoreline Park Oct. 29.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old called the potential career change “kind of wild,” but noted he’s already taken the first steps by passing a written exam with the San Francisco Police Department. Next comes a physical test, an extensive background check and basic police academy, followed hopefully by a police job in San Francisco.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Richard Charles Otter: September 13, 1933 – October 25, 2025.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Richard Charles Otter (September 13, 1933 – October 25, 2025) passed away peacefully, surrounded by family, in his home in Hillsborough, California. Throughout his incredible 92 years, Dick was remarkable in his ability to forge new connections and lifelong friendships. Whether aboard the Tiburon Ferry exchanging stories with neighbors, sharing laughs around a domino table, meeting prospective clients in his office, or offering thoughtful counsel at a board meeting, Dick’s warm smile and sparkling personality created genuine bonds with effortless ease, well into his ninth decade.</p>
<p>He was a seventh generation San Franciscan; tracing his ancestry to the late 18th century when his Spanish forebears came to California from Mexico. As his father was the manager of the Yosemite Lodge for decades, his childhood was split between Berkeley and the iconic Yosemite Valley. Spending his summers each year in the valley, Dick developed lifelong bonds to every aspect of that amazing place. Those links led to his eventually serving as chairman of the Yosemite Fund (now Yosemite Conservancy). He also served as the chair of the Save the Redwood League and on the board for more than 30 years — over which time he reviewed more than 200 acquisitions and 73,000 acres of California redwood forest. His connection to Yosemite also led to his serving as a founding member of the new University of California, Merced Foundation, the newest in the UC system, founded in 2005.</p>
<p>Dick was a proud Cal Bear, enrolling in UC Berkeley after graduating from Berkeley High. He was a member of Theta Chi fraternity. After college, Dick served in the United States Marine Corps, flying helicopters in Asia between the Korean and Vietnam wars.</p>
<p>Professionally, Dick would proudly describe himself as “just a stockbroker.” However, his modest description did not fully capture the role he played in creating and protecting wealth for his legions of loyal clients. He joined the famed San Francisco investment firm Davis, Skaggs & Co. in 1960 and retired 65 years later after that firm eventually transformed itself into Morgan Stanley. He famously never changed jobs — just the company name on the business card was frequently updated. Dick’s understanding of world markets was the product of lifelong curiosity and careful study of financial, economic, and political trends. He also shared his knowledge as an instructor of investments and economics at the College of Marin.</p>

     <title>Travel Bug: Exploring the high country offers fresh approach to Yosemite</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/travel-bug-exploring-the-high-country-offers-fresh-approach-to-yosemite</link>
     <description>Over the past three years, I have been questioning whether Yosemite was worth the frustration.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, our family visited Yosemite regularly, camping under canvas, staying in tent cabins and hiking between the High Sierra Camps. During off-peak months, we booked rooms at the Yosemite Valley Lodge. We once splurged on the Ahwahnee Hotel but found the experience underwhelming. Today, standard rooms at the Ahwahnee command $515 to $1,259 per night depending on seasonal demand, and reservations must be secured months in advance. Over the past three years, I’ve endured last-minute cancellations and struggled to secure any reservations at all. I began questioning whether Yosemite was worth the frustration.</p>
<p>Back in early August, before the federal shutdown, I decided to research alternative approaches to experiencing Yosemite’s high country — hopefully with fewer crowds and complications. I discovered three lodges near the Big Oak Flat entrance: Evergreen Lodge, Rush Creek Lodge and Blackberry Inn. We secured several mid-week nights at Evergreen Lodge without difficulty, drawn by its reputation for secluded, natural accommodations.</p>
<p>At Evergreen Lodge, I immediately began exploring the property, photographing the individual cabins, swimming pool, spa facilities and extensive recreational amenities. The 22-acre grounds house both traditional cabins and 22 luxury tents, scattered throughout the forested landscape to create an authentic wilderness experience. The lodge has become a sought-after wedding destination — staff informed us that every weekend through fall was completely booked with ceremonies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>I got to relax in a hammock at Evergreen Lodge, located near Yosemite’s Big Oak Flat entrance, which features traditional cabins and luxury tents, a pool, hot tub, play areas and bocce courts. The property provides a base for visitors exploring Olmsted Point — with its views of Half Dome — and less-crowded high-country destinations like May Lake and Tenaya Lake.

     <title>Neighbors threaten lawsuit over Strawberry senior-care project</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/neighbors-threaten-lawsuit-over-strawberry-senior-care-project</link>
     <description>The five-story, 150,655-square-foot building would house 106 units on a vacant lot at 70 N. Knoll Road, standing more than 60 feet tall.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated:27 minutes ago</p>
<p>A fight is brewing over a senior-care facility planned for a Strawberry hillside, with neighbors threatening legal action and calling the project “absolutely, unequivocally insane.”</p>
<p>The five-story, 150,655-square-foot building would house 106 units on a vacant lot at 70 N. Knoll Road, standing more than 60 feet tall near homes in what residents describe as a semi-rural neighborhood. Marin County is moving forward with review and potential approval of the plan through a streamlining process that limits public input.</p>
<p>One local group led by Strawberry resident Scott Arwin said it is considering a lawsuit to block the facility. The group held a meeting at an Eagle Rock Road home Oct. 29 to organize opposition. Members cite safety risks for seniors, increased traffic, environmental concerns and the project’s poor fit with the area’s character, as well as noise, light and air-quality issues.</p>
<p>The developers — brothers Ali Shabahangi and Amir Kia of San Anselmo-based Spirit Living Group — submitted their latest application revision Oct. 6. The proposal includes 71 independent-living apartments and 35 assisted-living and memory-care suites on 3.7 acres of the 6.6-acre site, with the remaining acreage preserved as open space. The county is reviewing it and has until tomorrow, Nov. 6, to deem it complete or incomplete under the ministerial-review process.</p>
<p>“I just think it’s unfortunate that some neighbors are considering legal action against the project,” Shabahangi said in an interview. “It’s a project that I think addresses the lack of housing, particularly senior housing in the area. And we also understand that the state has established safeguards to prevent misuse of litigation to block housing. But our hope is that it doesn’t come to that.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere commission backs zoning changes for new housing</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-commission-backs-zoning-changes-for-new-housing</link>
     <description>The Planning Commission unanimously recommended zoning changes that would accommodate at least 160 new housing units</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By KEVIN HESSEL and TYLER CALLISTER</p>
<p>After nearly three years out of compliance with state housing requirements, Belvedere moved a step closer Oct. 21 when the Planning Commission unanimously recommended zoning changes that would accommodate at least 160 new housing units.</p>
<p>Both the revised housing element and related zoning amendments will go to the Belvedere City Council at its Nov. 10 meeting.</p>
<p>The move codifies changes the city made to its state-mandated housing element, which received tentative approval from the California Department of Housing and Community Development in July after three failed attempts.</p>
<p>Belvedere cannot be deemed compliant until all necessary rezoning matches the housing element. After City Council approval, the city will submit final versions to the state housing agency for certification.</p>
<p>The changes cover affordable-housing requirements and incentives, streamlined approval for developments with at least 20% affordable housing, design and development standards, mixed-use housing, emergency shelters, parking and reasonable-accommodation requests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Documentary traces mountain lion&apos;s trek through Tiburon and beyond</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/documentary-traces-mountain-lion-s-trek-through-tiburon-and-beyond</link>
     <description>The film is streaming online through Oct. 30 as part of the 2025 Green Film Festival of San Francisco.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated:27 minutes ago</p>
<p>Fairfax resident Amelie Bluestone had long been fascinated by mountain lions when she learned about P36, the juvenile male that visited the Tiburon Peninsula in 2023 during a 1,400-mile trek across the Bay Area.</p>
<p>“P36 is a great example of what mountain lions go through on a day-to-day basis, but he did travel a remarkable distance,” she says. “And that’s what made him stand out to me and what made his story so interesting.”</p>
<p>Bluestone directed “The Path of Puma-36,” a documentary short film that follows P36’s 17-month journey across Northern California while wearing a tracking collar as part of the Living with Lions project at Stinson Beach-based conservation nonprofit All Hands Ecology, founded as Audubon Canyon Ranch by late Belvedere conservationist Marty Griffin in 1962.</p>
<p>Bluestone’s film is streaming online through Oct. 30 as part of the 2025 Green Film Festival of San Francisco following a showing at San Francisco’s 4 Star Theater Oct. 25. She plans another screening in Fairfax in December, though details are still being worked out, and she also plans to make the documentary available online after she finishes the film-festival circuit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earlier this month, Tiburon police received a call reporting an “ongoing issue with boats continuing to use megaphones” in the area of Keil Cove, according to dispatch logs. Marin County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Adam Schermerhorn confirmed his office has also received a complaint.</p>
<p>Patricia Lakner, who lives on Mar East Street, said she regularly hears bullhorns from fishing-charter boats. She said at least four other neighbors also have complained.</p>
<p>“There are noise ordinances in effect practically everywhere that limit time and volume, and the bay should not be exempt,” she said by email. “Our complaint is not that there are fishing boats, but that they are unnecessarily loud, especially in the wee hours of the morning.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Funding for the design work was included as part of the town’s capital-improvement program for fiscal year 2025-2026. The streets, all of which need “light maintenance,” according to a staff report, were selected in April after a roads assessment conducted by the town and funded by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, which doles out money to jurisdictions every three years for the evaluations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Father-and-son Tiburon rowers share bond while tackling Boston’s iconic Head of the Charles</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/father-and-son-tiburon-rowers-share-bond-while-tackling-boston-s-iconic-head-of-the-charles</link>
     <description>The Tiburon father and son competed in the Directors’ Challenge Parent/Child Doubles race during the 2025 Head of the Charles Regatta.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Brian and Felix Davis, rowing is a family affair.</p>
<p>The Tiburon father and son competed in the Directors’ Challenge Parent/Child Doubles race during the 2025 Head of the Charles Regatta Oct. 19, the final day of the three-day annual regatta on the Charles River in Boston. The regatta is considered the largest in the sport by participants.</p>
<p>Both Davises row in eight-person sweeps in their respective age groups at the Greenbrae-based Marin Rowing Association, where they train six days a week. In sweeps, each rower uses a single oar while a ninth person serves as coxswain. Like father, like son: both row port side.</p>
<p>The parent-child race offered a unique opportunity for Brian and Felix to try sculling, where rowers propel the boat with two oars and no coxswain.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of helpful for the regular rowing stroke in our other boats because it helps with a balance aspect and putting everything together,” says Felix, a junior at Redwood High School. “And I think it actually helps apply to our other boats also, which is really great.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A Bay Area local shows East Coast friend the Golden State</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-bay-area-local-shows-east-coast-friend-the-golden-state</link>
     <description>It was the first time in Tiburon for both, one of several stops on Danser’s trip from New York City to visit Yang, who lives in San Jose.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Daltin Danser and Alex Yang grab coffees from Caffe Acri on Main Street Oct. 22 before boarding a morning ferry to visit Angel Island.</p>
<p>It was the first time in Tiburon for both, one of several stops on Danser’s trip from New York City to visit Yang, who lives in San Jose. The two had already explored San Francisco and were planning to visit Yosemite.</p>
<p>“I’m just kind of his driver,” Yang, 23, says of his role for Danser’s visit.</p>
<p>Danser, 22, meanwhile, has been acting as the official photographer for their trips, with Yang noting his friend’s particular fascination with plaques at sites and landmarks.</p>
<p>“He was scrolling through his camera, and he has like hundreds of them,” Yang says of Danser’s photos of plaques. “And I’m sure he’s never looked at them again.”</p>
<p>Danser is quick to challenge his friend’s assertion.</p>
<p>“I always look back at my plaques,” he says, adding that his favorite he captured so far was from their recent visit to Muir Woods National Monument.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon Town Hall exhibits feature multimedia collages, oil paintings</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-town-hall-exhibits-feature-multimedia-collages-oil-paintings</link>
     <description>Tiburon Heritage and Arts Commissioner Jaleh Etemad and Larkspur resident Debra Maddox are each exhibiting their works at Town Hall starting in November.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>‘Unseen’ is part of former Tiburon artist laureate Jaleh Etemad’s new Town Hall exhibit, opening Nov. 3, while 'Blue Polka Dot Dress’ is among the works on display at Debra Maddox’s Town Hall exhibit, ‘Evocations.’</p>
<p>Tiburon Heritage and Arts Commissioner Jaleh Etemad and Larkspur resident Debra Maddox are each exhibiting their works at Town Hall starting in November.</p>
<p>Etemad will show her multimedia collage works in a new exhibit opening Nov. 3 in the downstairs lobby. The exhibit coincides with the debut of her book, “Art of Life: Works by Jaleh Azar Etemad,” which includes nearly 300 of her pieces.</p>
<p>Etemad’s exhibit runs through Dec. 1 and features 35 paintings. An artist’s reception is set for 6-8 p.m. Nov. 7 at Town Hall and will include a conversation between Etemad and theater director, producer and educator Ginny Reed. Etemad will also sign copies of the book, which documents her evolution as an artist with numerous photos of her works. Each chapter describes moments that inspired her and the wide array of genres she has explored, including layered collage, painting, photography, altered books and three-dimensional works.</p>
<p>“As we live our lives, we evolve as human beings based on our various experiences,” she says. “I have done the same through my art.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Maddox’s exhibit, “Evocations,” will run Nov. 1-Dec. 31 in the upstairs Community Room and features two series of works in oil on canvas or oil on birch. An artist’s reception is set for 6-8 p.m. Nov. 11.</p>
<p>“I watch how light, shadow, color and texture transform shapes, and forms into compelling compositions,” she says. “This drives my desire to interpret what I see in the world around me. My work reflects two components — one is visual and the other is emotional.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Prescribed burn on Angel Island to begin as early as Oct. 31</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/prescribed-burn-on-angel-island-to-begin-as-early-as-oct-31</link>
     <description>The actual start date will depend on weather conditions, with the target Nov. 2.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated:27 minutes ago</p>
<p>Up to 100 acres of Angel Island State Park will undergo a prescribed burn beginning as early as Oct. 31.</p>
<p>California State Parks is leading the burn operation. Officials said in an Oct. 28 news release that residents should not call 911 to report smoke on the island.</p>
<p>State parks interpreter Ryan Forbes said in an email that while the prescribed burns may start as early as Halloween, the actual start date will depend on weather conditions. He said the burn will likely take place Nov. 2.</p>
<p>Smoke will likely be visible from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on burn days and may be visible for up to three days.</p>
<p>The operation aims to reduce fuel loads — combustible materials — in grasslands and coast-scrub areas on Angel Island.</p>
<p>The state park will remain open during burn days, and Angel Island-Tiburon Ferry service will not be affected, but trails and roads near the burn area will be closed for one to three days during and after the burn. Affected routes include segments of the Ida and Sunset trails and Park Fire Road. Access to Mount Livermore’s peak may also be limited on burn days.</p>
<p>Parks officials urged extreme caution for Angel Island visitors near the fire burns and asked them to follow posted signage and directions from parks staff or fire officials.</p>
<p>The burn is part of the parks agency’s Prescribed Fire Training Exchange, which gives firefighters and other fire personnel the opportunity to hone skills.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Reed district warned to rein in deficit spending</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-district-warned-to-rein-in-deficit-spending</link>
     <description>Unless the district cuts $1.75 million over two years, its reserves will fall short of the required 27% minimum by fiscal year 2027-2028.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Marin County Office of Education has warned the Reed Union School District about its “unsustainable” deficit spending, noting that unless the district cuts about $1.75 million from its budget in the next two years, it will fall short of its reserve goals by fiscal 2027-2028.</p>
<p>The warning was issued in a Sept. 15 letter approving the district’s current-year $33.2-million budget and its accompanying projections two years out; the county Office of Education is required to review the budget annually under the state education code to ensure it meets state standards for fiscal solvency and aligns with the district’s Local Control Accountability Plan.</p>
<p>Though the county has vouched for the district’s ability to meet its financial obligations in the next three years, the letter notes the district’s planned deficit spending will shrink its ending fund balance by 35% in that time as it pulls from its reserves to close the gap. That projection, it notes, is inclusive of a planned $300,000 in salary reductions beginning in the 2026-2027 school year.</p>
<p>If the district continues to deficit spend at the projected rates, the county letter says, its unrestricted general fund balance will fall to about 21.5% of expenditures, or about $7.6 million, by fiscal year 2027-2028 — short of the district policy that requires a minimum reserve of 27% of expenditures.</p>]]></content:encoded>
