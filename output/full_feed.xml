     <title>Tiburon to be first city in nation to ban all tobacco sales without exceptions</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-to-be-first-city-in-nation-to-ban-all-tobacco-sales-without-exceptions</link>
     <description>The new law will take effect Dec. 5 following the Town Council’s unanimous approval Oct. 15 and its expected vote to formally adopt on Nov. 5.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twenty years after Tiburon sparked a nationwide movement to ban trans fats, the town is poised to become the first city in the nation to ban all tobacco sales without exemptions.</p>
<p>The new law will take effect Dec. 5 following the Town Council’s unanimous approval Oct. 15 and its anticipated support in a second, required vote to formally adopt the ordinance, scheduled for Nov. 5.</p>
<p>Beverly Hills and Manhattan Beach enacted tobacco sales bans in 2021, but Beverly Hills allows hotels to sell to guests and Manhattan Beach includes a hardship exemption for businesses. Tiburon’s ordinance contains no such exceptions, though it does not apply to products intended to help people quit smoking.</p>
<p>“You can be proud of the fact that you’ve pushed the envelope even further, and you are truly the first to accomplish this complete ban without any exemptions,” Jeremiah Mock told councilmembers after the vote.</p>
<p>Mock, a University of California at San Francisco professor who researches human tobacco waste as a health anthropologist and garbologist, told the council that “the decisions you’re making are not only with regard to the health of people but also to the environment that you live in and that you’re custodians of as public servants.”</p>
<p>The ban positions Tiburon at the forefront of the Tobacco Endgame Movement, an American Heart Association initiative aimed at ending commercial tobacco and nicotine use. Recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show more than 57% of adults surveyed supported eliminating all tobacco product sales.</p>
<p>Youth advocates cite vaping rates</p>
<p>The Youth Advocacy Committee, a group of Marin County high-school students working to reduce teen smoking, vaping and nicotine use, brought the request to the council. The group, which is also working to ban tobacco sales in Ross, reached out to Mayor Holli Thier, who placed the ordinance on the agenda.</p>
<p>Youth advocates cited alarming local statistics. The California Healthy Kids Survey reported that 11% of ninth graders and 16% of 11th graders in the Tamalpais Union High School District — which includes Redwood High School serving the Tiburon Peninsula — used vaping products in 2023-2024, compared to statewide averages of 5% for freshmen and 7% for juniors.</p>
<p>Diana Garcia, a Novato High School junior and one of three Youth Advocacy Committee presenters, said banning tobacco would ensure retailers “don’t enter Tiburon now or in the future.”</...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Sculpted busts recall Tiburon life in the 1950s, ’60s</title>

     <description>Howard Lazar&apos;s exhibit features painted busts and written vignettes reflecting on teachers, shopkeepers and friends.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When sculptor Howard Lazar worked at a coffee shop as a teenager in Tiburon, a railroad worker named Smitty would come in and order from him.</p>
<p>Whether it was a large combo lunch or a slice of pie and a late-afternoon cup of coffee, the railroad worker would always tip the teen $1. Those consistent $1 tips from Smitty, Lazar later discovered, came after the railroad worker learned Lazar was commuting from Tiburon to attend San Francisco State University.</p>
<p>“Cost being what it was, he was trying to help me out,” Lazar says of Smitty.</p>
<p>Smitty is one of eight people Lazar, now 77, has created life-size busts of for his new exhibit, “Notable People I Grew Up Knowing,” which will run Oct. 24-26 at the Belvedere-Tiburon Landmarks Society’s China Cabin. Alongside the busts, Lazar has written vignettes reflecting on how they impacted him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere band keeps community in tune with backyard jam sessions</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-band-keeps-community-in-tune-with-backyard-jam-sessions</link>
     <description>For five years, eight musicians have turned a Belvedere backyard into a weekly community gathering with rock classics and potluck meals.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every Tuesday night for the past five years, rock ’n’ roll has spilled from Mac Couto’s backyard on Laurel Street into the quiet Belvedere evening. Under bistro lights strung across a white marquee tent, eight musicians work through a catalog of more than 300 songs while neighbors arrive with plates of food and bottles of wine.</p>
<p>They call themselves the Windsor Street Blues Band, and on Oct. 10, they brought their neighborhood tradition to a wider stage.</p>
<p>The band opened the second annual Belvedere Home-Made Film Festival at Belvedere Community Park, performing seven songs for a lawn-seated audience of 200 community members before the screening of more than 30 resident-made films on the theme of community. They played classics like “This House is Rockin’,” “The Boxer” and “Monster Mash” — a fitting preview for an evening celebrating what brings neighbors together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Sea Ranch residents say they’ve long enjoyed visiting Tiburon and plan to spend several nights in town before returning to the unincorporated community on the northern Sonoma County coast bordering Mendocino County, where they’ve lived for roughly seven years.</p>
<p>“It’s just a very low-key, convenient, not spread out all over the place kind of place where you can come and go across the street to get dinner and come back,” Beverly says of Tiburon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>The platform charges homebuyers 0.75% compared to traditional agent fees of 2.5% to 3%, potentially saving tens of thousands of dollars.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tiburon resident has launched a real-estate platform that charges homebuyers a quarter of traditional agent fees.</p>
<p>J. Dean Modir, 40, foundedZeego.ai, which launched two weeks ago as an alternative for California homebuyers comfortable doing much of the legwork in searching for a home.</p>
<p>Modir said his website caters to the tech-savvy homebuyer who can analyze data and conduct research independently, while serving as a complement to the homebuying ecosystem. He noted that most homebuyers will still need the support a real-estate agent provides.</p>
<p>“But I started to hear more and more people say, ‘Hey, you know, I already found this property myself, I toured it myself, and I really just need an agent to help me pencil it or get through the offer, maybe get the right forms in place, but I don’t really need that much help outside of that,’” Modir says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon family reunited with missing dog after standoff; woman arrested</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-family-reunited-with-missing-dog-after-standoff-woman-arrested</link>
     <description>Police recover pet after owner tracks it with AirTag.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tiburon woman was arrested Oct. 2 on suspicion of grand theft and resisting police after the owner of a missing dog tracked her cavapoo to the woman’s apartment using an Apple AirTag.</p>
<p>The 60-year-old resident was booked into Marin County Jail and released Oct. 3 after posting bail. The Marin District Attorney’s Office is reviewing the case.</p>
<p>The Ark is not identifying the woman because no charges had been filed by press time Oct. 14.</p>
<p>Police say the woman picked up the 5-year-old cavapoo, named Lani, after it escaped from owners Lea and Timothy Inbody’s yard Oct. 1. Officers obtained a search warrant after the woman allegedly refused to return the dog and demanded $250, flowers and fruit in exchange for its release.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Ark, the woman said she found the dog and had tried to locate its owner. She disputed the allegations against her.</p>
<p>Lea Inbody said Lani disappeared from her backyard and suspected a delivery driver left the gate open, allowing the dog to wander off. It had happened before, Inbody said, and neighbors typically called when they spotted Lani.</p>
<p>This time, no one did.</p>
<p>After hours of searching with no leads, Inbody used her phone to check the location of the AirTag on Lani’s collar. The signal pointed to an apartment at The Hilarita complex on Ned’s Way, about 500 feet downhill of the Inbodys’ Spring Lane home. She knocked repeatedly that afternoon and evening. No one answered.</p>
<p>Inbody said she wondered if the AirTag had fallen off or malfunctioned. As night fell and rain began, she gathered her two sons — ages 2 and 4 — and searched the neighborhood but began losing hope.</p>
<p>“I thought it was so weird that nobody’s seen her,” she said. “I never figured that someone stole my dog. I thought she’d been eaten by a coyote or hit by a car.”</p>
<p>“It was horrible,” she said. “And it was so unfortunate because I have a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old that I’m trying to stay positive for. And they’re crying and looking for their dog.”</p>
<p>The next day, Oct. 2, Inbody posted Lani’s photo online on NextDoor, asking for help. That afternoon, while searching near Ned’s Way again with her older son, a Hilarita resident told Inbody she’d seen the dog with a neighbor, at the same apartment Inbody tried previously.</p>
<p>Inbody says she returned to the apartment and knocked.</p>
<p>“The second I say, ‘dog,’ she deadbolts her door and acts like nobody’s home,” Inbody alleged. “So ...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon Peninsula crew sails to third J105 title in four years</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-peninsula-crew-sails-to-third-j105-title-in-four-years</link>
     <description>Team Niuhi overcame a broken mast two weeks before the regatta to dominate the field.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks before the world’s most prestigious J105 sailing regatta in September, Tiburon skipper Randy Hecht took a phone call in Copenhagen, Denmark, where he was racing 4,000 miles from home.</p>
<p>His crew had just hauled their 7,750-pound keelboat more than 2,600 miles from Belvedere to Toronto in preparation for the J105 North American Championship on Lake Ontario. But the news wasn’t good.</p>
<p>“We had dropped the boat off in the yard in Toronto, and the yard decided to reposition the boat someplace else,” Hecht said. “The mast was on top of the boat, and they accidentally hooked the mast on the corner of some building and bent it.”</p>
<p>The boat, called Niuhi — which means “man-eating shark” in Hawaiian — desperately needed a mast.</p>
<p>“My thought was how can I possibly concentrate on the Copenhagen race and figure out how to deal with this broken mast,” Hecht said. “I got about two weeks to sort it out. I thought about throwing in the towel.”</p>
<p>He didn’t. Instead, the San Francisco Yacht Club-based crew went on to win its third North American Championship in four years, beating 17 other competitors including one of the world’s greatest sailors. The victory at the Sept. 17-20 regatta continued the dominance of a team that has made the Bay Area’s sailing community a national powerhouse in the J105 class — a 34-foot, one-design racing keelboat.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Harband has already raised more than $11,000 toward his $15,000 goal for the Challenged Athletes Foundation&apos;s Million Dollar Challenge.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three times a week, Tiburon resident Jeff Harband rides 20-60 miles on his bicycle. But now the 61-year-old is gearing up for his longest ride yet: a 625-mile trek to raise money for athletes with physical disabilities.</p>
<p>Harband has set a$15,000 fundraising goalfor his Million Dollar Challenge bike ride to benefit the San Diego-based nonprofit Challenged Athletes Foundation. The organization assists those with permanent physical disabilities in pursuing healthy lifestyles and professional athletic competitions, including by providing financial support for adaptive equipment, travel and competition fees.</p>
<p>“As a physical therapist, I’ve always been interested in helping people with disabilities — never really had the chance within my practice,” Harband says, adding that because he didn’t see many people with disabilities in Marin, he views his volunteering work “as a way for me to get more involved with that.”</p>
<p>Alongside 120 other cyclists, some of whom will use adaptive equipment, Harband will bike from Santa Rosa to San Diego Oct. 17-24.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The town’s Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission voted unanimously Sept. 30 to appoint Vice Chair Mike Ghaffary and member Chuck Hornbrook to a subcommittee that will develop recommendations for the heavily used stretch.</p>
<p>The town’s parks master plan, adopted in 2024, calls for designing interventions to slow speeds and establish clear understanding of shared space. The plan also suggests creating separate bike and pedestrian paths where adequate right of way exists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Scanlon&apos;s 200-piece collection includes Dwight Clark&apos;s cleats, Reggie Jackson&apos;s bat and even locks of hair from an unnamed Beatle.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Tiburon resident Kevin Scanlon, cleats autographed by 49ers legend Dwight Clark aren’t just old shoes. A bat used by Reggie Jackson isn’t just a slab of wood. And those locks of hair from an unnamed Beatle aren’t just a curiosity.</p>
<p>They’re memories — things that remind him of growing up.</p>
<p>“We always collect things in the past that made us feel good or that we remember,” says Scanlon, 64, who has spent three decades building a collection of more than 200 pieces of sports and music memorabilia.</p>
<p>His treasures span Bay Area sports history, from the San Francisco 49ers and Giants and Golden State Warriors to the former Oakland Raiders and Athletics. His music collection centers on The Beatles, including the locks preserved in their original plastic bag— though Scanlon notes the Beatle was never identified.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Hernandez documents his Bay Area fishing adventures on social media, where he connected with his friend Benitez over their shared hobby.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joseph Hernandez stands at the end of Elephant Rock pier Oct. 1 and whips his fishing rod through the air. The white rubber lure, fashioned to look like a tiny minnow, sails 100 feet or so before landing in the bay.</p>
<p>Hernandez, 19, and his friend Robert Benitez, 20, wait for signs of a bite. The two say fishing is a favorite pastime. Hernandez points to the water as a sea lion emerges on the surface.</p>
<p>“Look at this guy,” he says. “They’re always out here. The birds, the waves, the sounds. There’s always something out here.”</p>
<p>Hernandez frequently documents his Bay Area fishing adventures on TikTok under the handle @mond0.joj0 and on Instagram under the handle @mondo.joj0.</p>
<p>It was through social media that Hernandez, who is from Santa Rosa, and Benitez, who is from Novato, became friends. Benitez says he reached out to Hernandez on social media after seeing one of Hernandez’s videos, and the two hit it off. Hernandez is a roofer by trade, often doing jobs in Marin County, while Benitez is studying at Santa Rosa Junior College to earn his emergency medical responder certification in hopes of eventually becoming a firefighter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Zheng takes Tiburon Challenger crown in flawless week</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/zheng-takes-tiburon-challenger-crown-in-flawless-week</link>
     <description>The Columbia University senior didn&apos;t drop a single set en route to his third consecutive Challenger title.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Zheng boarded his red-eye flight back to Columbia University with some newly minted silverware in his carry-on bag — the Tiburon Challenger men’s singles trophy.</p>
<p>Zheng, a senior at the school and the defending NCAA Division I men’s singles champion, defeated fellow American Tyler Zink in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4, on Oct. 5 at the Tiburon Peninsula Club. The 21-year-old didn’t have much time to savor the victory, though — he had to head to the airport to get home in time for a Spanish test the following morning.</p>
<p>His win came one day after the tournament’s doubles final, in which the top-seeded pairing of Finn Reynolds and James Watt, both of New Zealand, defeated Americans Benjamin Kittay and Joshua Sheehy Oct. 4 in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3. The doubles win for Reynolds and Watt marked sweet revenge for the Kiwis: They lost to Kittay and Sheehy in the final at the Las Vegas Tennis Open on Sept. 27.</p>
<p>Both matches were the culmination of the weeklong tournament that began Sept. 28. Players in the Challenger Tour are trying to earn enough points to become eligible to enter the ATP Tour and Grand Slam tournaments, which include Wimbledon and the Australian, French and U.S. Opens.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon picks designers to bring new life to town&apos;s parks</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-picks-designers-to-bring-new-life-to-town-s-parks</link>
     <description>Community feedback from two years of engagement will guide designers creating plans for the former sanitation ponds site and mini parks.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon moved a step closer to upgrading the former sanitation ponds site and three neighborhood mini parks, with a town commission selecting two design firms to create plans for potential amenities including beach-volleyball courts and new swings.</p>
<p>The Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission on Sept. 30 unanimously recommended the Town Council hire Mill Valley-based RHAA Landscape Architecture and Planning for the former ponds site near McKegney Green and nearby Belveron Mini Park. It also recommended Santa Rosa-based Carlile Macy Inc. to do the same for Cypress Hollow Park and the Bel Aire play area.</p>
<p>The total design costs are estimated to reach at least $500,000, $289,712 for RHAA and $209,838 for Carlile Macy. The scope of work for both includes creating a conceptual and final design and developing community-engagement plans. Any actual construction would need to be vetted and approved by both the parks commission and Town Council, with opportunities for public comment.</p>
<p>The council is tentatively set to vote on the recommendation at its Oct. 15 meeting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Tiburon to remove invasive weeds at Railroad Marsh after condo residents report rat infestation linked to overgrown vegetation behind units.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will remove invasive weeds and plants behind Point Tiburon Marsh condominiums after residents complained the overgrown vegetation is contributing to a rat infestation — a renewed attempt at maintenance after work was halted in October 2023 when a biologist spotted what was believed to be a threatened California red-legged frog.</p>
<p>Lafayette-based DK Environmental & Construction Services Inc. will begin removing emerging aquatic weeds, invasive blackberry bushes and other nonaquatic vegetation this month along the southern edge of Railroad Marsh, which sits off Mar West Street behind the Belvedere-Tiburon Library, Tiburon Town Hall and the 34-unit condo complex on Marsh Road.</p>
<p>That 2023 maintenance work to clear 750 tons of cattails was roughly 70% complete but did not resume following the work stoppage, leaving part of the marsh overgrown. The California red-legged frog is listed as threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Strawberry journalist creates studio to capture life stories on film</title>

     <description>Journalist Priya David Clemens launches studio to create personal documentaries. Her first film profiles Tiburon surgeon Angelo Capozzi.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strawberry resident and longtime journalist Priya David Clemens decided to honor her father ahead of his 75th birthday by creating a video of his life story to showcase at his party.</p>
<p>The response to the video was overwhelmingly positive, she says. She showed the video again at her father’s memorial service in 2024; he died at the age of 84 after battling dementia for two years and, at the time of his death, was unable to recall or share many of his memories, she says.</p>
<p>After the memorial screening, Clemens says she was approached by many attendees with the same sentiment: “I wish I had this for my mom or my dad. I wish that I could do something like this.”</p>
<p>The experience prompted Clemens to createKeepsake Studios, a business that creates personal documentaries of people, couples and families for special occasions.The company’s first completed documentary is of Tiburon resident Angelo Capozzi, the 92-year-old plastic surgeon who cofounded Rotaplast, a nonprofit that provides surgery to children with a cleft lip or palate anomalies who otherwise would not receive treatment. Since 1992, the organization has conducted 372 missions to perform surgery on nearly 22,000 patients.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Local officials plan microgrid connecting Town Hall and library for emergency power during natural disasters and public safety shutoffs.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon Town Hall and the Belvedere-Tiburon Library would serve as a combined community resilience center with backup power for residents during major outages caused by natural disasters under a plan now being developed by local officials.</p>
<p>Engineers from the Bay Area Regional Energy Network visited both Tiburon Boulevard buildings in mid-September to conduct an energy roadmap assessment. It will analyze what infrastructure is needed to keep both buildings operational during emergencies. Community resilience centers coordinate services and distribute resources before, during and after natural disasters through power systems that keep heating, cooling and lighting operational during outages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounter: A couple savors the moment on shores of Richardson Bay</title>

     <description>Wade and Norleak Winblad find tranquility along Richardson Bay, reflecting on simple living and appreciating everyday moments.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wade and Norleak Winblad dip their toes into Richardson Bay near Greenwood Cove Drive Sept. 24, savoring a quiet moment in camping chairs along the water’s edge.</p>
<p>Wade says the water temperature is not as cold as he expected.</p>
<p>“It just makes me want to jump in and go swimming out there,” he says — though he resists the urge. “I know when you get past your waist or so, it’s a whole different world.”</p>
<p>The Corte Madera couple, married 11 years, were seeking relief from last week’s muggy mini heat wave. Wade says soaking their feet in the water is therapeutic. The week’s temperatures reached the high 80s Sept. 23 and the high 70s the following day — mild for Norleak, who hails from Cambodia.</p>
<p>“It’s like 100 degrees every day there,” she says.</p>]]></content:encoded>
