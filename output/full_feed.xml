     <title>Marin OKs 106-unit senior facility off North Knoll Road</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/marin-oks-106-unit-senior-facility-off-north-knoll-road</link>
     <description>The county’s approval through a state-mandated ministerial review process on Dec. 23 leaves opponents with no avenue for appeal.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marin County has approved a controversial five-story senior care facility off Strawberry’s North Knoll Road, ending more than a year of neighborhood opposition to a project that will tower over single-family homes.</p>
<p>The 106-unit, 150,655-square-foot residential care facility will stand 63 feet, 6 inches tall on a 6.6-acre hillside site now addressed as 100 Thomas Place. The county’s approval through a state-mandated ministerial review process on Dec. 23 leaves opponents with no avenue for appeal.</p>
<p>Ali Shabahangi of San Anselmo-based Spirit Living Group LLC confirmed the developers intend to apply for building permits but said it’s too early to announce a construction timeline.</p>
<p>“While project approval is an important milestone, in many ways our work is just beginning,” he said. “The next phase involves complying with each of the county’s conditions of approval through the permitting process, which is rigorous and requires detailed technical analysis, including pedestrian and roadway improvements. Only after that work is complete will we be able to establish a construction timeline.”</p>
<p>Senior Planner Megan Alton estimated the building-permit process could take six months — double the typical three months for a single-family home.</p>
<p>The facility will include 71 apartments with kitchens for independent living — 39 studios or one-bedrooms and 32 two-bedrooms or larger — and 35 assisted-living and memory-care suites without cooking facilities. A subterranean garage will provide 72 parking spaces. Common areas will include dining rooms, activity spaces, a theater, salon, library and fitness facilities. Other amenities include walking trails, a pool, bocce court and fire-truck turnaround.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere Land Co. property swaps set stage for housing development</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-land-co-property-swaps-set-stage-for-housing-development</link>
     <description>Belvedere&apos;s plan for 160 new housing units tailored 87 of those — 73 at The Boardwalk alone — to Land Co. properties.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belvedere Land Co. has completed a $63.5 million ownership restructuring among its family investors, consolidating control of 70 units across 15 properties one day after the city submitted its 2023-2031 housing element to the state for certification.</p>
<p>Though The Boardwalk shopping center does not appear on the Dec. 12 transaction list, the internal moves were largely designed around simplifying the ownership structure of the downtown site to facilitate anticipated mixed-use redevelopment there, Land Co. family representative Jim Allen said last week.</p>
<p>Allen said property swaps narrowing The Boardwalk ownership group shifted equity among existing family owners, with each family group now controlling whole properties rather than fractional pieces across the portfolio. The swaps range from 532 San Rafael Ave., valued at $1.23 million and representing two units at 528, 532 and 536 San Rafael Ave., to the $18.4 million Ark apartments complex at 7 Cove Road site, a three-building, 20-unit parcel that also includes 11 Cove Road and 25 Beach Road.</p>
<p>The timing of the Land Co. restructuring is significant. It follows a multiyear effort in which Belvedere was required to plan for at least 160 new housing units. The city tailored 87 of those — 73 at The Boardwalk alone — to Land Co. properties. The City Council adopted its state-mandated housing element and associated rezoning Dec. 8, formalizing zoning revisions the company indicated as necessary in an August 2022 interest letter and including targeted incentives to help ensure redevelopment makes sense financially.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Mar West residents must raise $55K for utility-burying plans</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/mar-west-residents-must-raise-55k-for-utility-burying-plans</link>
     <description>A group of Mar West residents must raise $55,250 toward engineering and design work to bury their utility lines.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of Mar West residents moved a step closer to burying overhead power lines after the Tiburon Town Council voted to require the neighborhood to raise $55,250 toward engineering and design work — with the town covering the remaining two-thirds of costs.</p>
<p>The 4-0 vote Jan. 5 gives the proposed 39-home, 35-parcel undergrounding district a clear fundraising target: one-third of an estimated $165,760 needed for completed designs and a final engineering report that would allow property owners to vote on forming the district.</p>
<p>Thirty of the homes in the proposed district have already expressed support for the project, said Miles Daly, a Mar West resident and district proponent.</p>
<p>The proposed district spans Mar West from its intersection with Esperanza Street to past its intersection with Las Lomas Lane, stopping before the Sanitary District No. 5 of Marin facility. The trench also splits off onto Esperanza Street and Las Lomas Lane.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere&apos;s Jeanne Price spent nearly four decades reporting for Ark, championed historic landmarks</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-s-jeanne-price-spent-nearly-four-decades-reporting-for-ark-championed-historic-landmarks</link>
     <description>37-year Ark reporter Jeanne Price, who championed historic-preservation efforts in Belvedere, died Dec. 26. She was 93.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Longtime Belvedere resident Jeanne Price, who spent 37 years reporting for The Ark and was involved in local preservation efforts with the Belvedere-Tiburon Landmarks Society, died at an assisted-living facility in San Francisco on Dec. 26. She was 93.</p>
<p>Price joined The Ark in June 1975 as the newspaper’s bird columnist and went on to cover Redwood High School, Strawberry and Belvedere, along with features and environmental issues. By her retirement in 2012, Price had worked under six executive editors, five publishers and two ownership changes.</p>
<p>“Her work was especially important in raising public consciousness and awareness about the downtown marsh, a freshwater pond that could have, at the time, been easily filled in and turned into another parking lot,” former Ark editor and publisher Brad Breithaupt said in a 2012 article on Price’s retirement. “But because people had been reading for years about the bounty of birds found in the marsh, the area was protected during the 1980s redevelopment.”</p>
<p>Price won a second-place award for in-depth reporting from the California News Publishers Association in 1985 for her coverage of Strawberry’s history and the issues facing the unincorporated community. She also received a Herbert Bayard Swope Memorial Award honorable mention in 1982 for 10 feature articles she wrote the prior year.</p>
<p>When Price retired, she was The Ark’s longest tenured reporter, and her service to the paper has only been surpassed by art critic Carol Benet, who celebrated 50 years writing for the paper in 2025.</p>
<p>Price’s final year with the paper was Executive Editor Kevin Hessel’s first.</p>
<p>“Jeanne was deeply connected to the community, her institutional knowledge was invaluable and she never hesitated to share it with colleagues or use it to add context that made stories better,” he said last week. “She helped me find my footing as a newcomer. I tried to trick her into staying, suggesting she shoot for an even 40 years.”</p>
<p>Price was also a member of the Belvedere Historic Preservation Committee, which reviews property owners’ applications to have their buildings designated as historic, and she was one of the earliest members of the Belvedere-Tiburon Landmarks Society, joining months after it was formed in 1959.</p>
<p>She wrote various articles for the society’s newsletter, The Landmark, served on its board for nine years and was its representative for the Art & Garden Center’s cottage restoration. She a...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon seeks volunteers for several boards, including planning, parks, arts, disaster</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-seeks-volunteers-for-several-boards-including-planning-parks-arts-disaster</link>
     <description>Tiburon residents have until 5 p.m. Feb. 13 to apply for 15 volunteer positions on nine town and county boards and commissions.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon residents have until 5 p.m. Feb. 13 to apply for 15 volunteer positions on nine town and county boards and commissions, with terms for most seats expiring at the end of February.</p>
<p>The openings span the Planning Commission; the Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission; the Heritage and Arts Commission; the Diversity Inclusion Task Force; the Belvedere-Tiburon Library Agency; the Belvedere-Tiburon Joint Disaster Advisory Council; the Building Code Appeals Board; the Marin-Sonoma Mosquito and Vector Control District Board; and the Marin Commission on Aging.</p>
<p>All seats are unpaid, volunteer positions, and applicants must be Tiburon residents, except for the Diversity Inclusion Task Force, which is open to Belvedere residents; the Disaster Advisory Council, which is open only to residents of unincorporated Tiburon; and the Building Code Appeals Board, which includes those who work in town, though candidates must have a working knowledge of the town’s building code.</p>
<p>Planning Commission, two four-year seats:The terms of Eric Woodward and Kathleen Defever expire Feb. 28. Woodward, a member since 2019, and Defever, who was first appointed in 2018, both said they plan to reapply. The five-member board is the town’s planning agency and meets on second and fourth Wednesdays to review items such as the general plan, conditional use permits, zoning and zoning text amendments.</p>
<p>Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission, two four-year seats:The terms of Michael Moon and Liz Judge expire Feb. 28.</p>
<p>Judge, who was appointed in 2022, said she was not reapplying because of increased professional commitments that have made it “really challenging to give (the commission) all the time I feel it deserves.” Moon, who was appointed in 2023 and is currently commission chair, did not respond by press deadline to an inquiry about whether he planned to reapply. The five-member commission meets on third Tuesdays every other month and makes recommendations to the Planning Commission and Town Council on policy matters pertaining to parks and open space under the town’s jurisdiction. It also serves as the town’s Bicycle-Pedestrian Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Heritage and Arts Commission, two four-year seats:The terms of Jaleh Etemad, who’s served since 2018, and Azita de Mujica, a commissioner since 2010, expire Feb. 28, and both said they will reapply. The seven-person commission meets on fourth Tuesdays with a mission to promote arts programs on the T...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Natalia Settembrini Casillas passed away on November 13, 2025, at the age of 83.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Natalia Settembrini Casillas passed away on November 13, 2025, at the age of 83, after a courageous battle with heart disease. She died peacefully, at home in Tiburon, surrounded by loved ones. She was the love of my life and my best friend.</p>
<p>Natalia was born in Puglia, a peninsula in Southern Italy surrounded by turquoise waters and white sandy beaches. Natalia loved to cook and entertain her family and friends. She often hosted large lunch and dinner parties at “Villa Natalia,” her beautiful hilltop home in Tiburon, with its panoramic views of the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, and the Bay, as well as the home’s terraces, tiles, and gardens that reminded her of the Amalfi Coast, one of her favorite parts of Italy.</p>
<p>Natalia is survived by her husband of 41 years, Mark Casillas of Tiburon, her two sons, five grandchildren, a great-grandson, and two sisters. A detailed obituary was published on her Facebook pagewww.facebook.com/natalia.settembrinicasillasand in the San Francisco Chronicle atwww.legacy.comorwww.bit.ly/NataliaCasillas.</p>
<p>Natalia’s funeral was at Queen of Heaven Cemetery, Lafayette, CA, where her remains reside. She would be delighted by your visit; she would greet you warmly with her beautiful smiling photo and memorial. In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to the American Heart Association.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Nature serves as inspiration for abstract works in Belvedere-Tiburon Library exhibit</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/nature-serves-as-inspiration-for-abstract-works-in-belvedere-tiburon-library-exhibit</link>
     <description>&quot;Abstracting Nature” at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library runs Jan. 15-March 11.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The inspiration for Jennifer Francis Fearon’s painting “Natural Optimism 2” came from a photo of light rippling on water.</p>
<p>The Belvedere artist made an engraved print from the photo, using a non-toxic process that included soy-based inks and Japanese paper. This print was then mounted on a wood panel and overpainted with mineral pigments.</p>
<p>For Fearon, 64, painting is a way to “stay present, to notice small movements and moments that might otherwise be missed.”</p>
<p>“My work is really about paying attention to place, to materials and to the subtle forces that connect us to the natural world we live in every day,” she says.</p>
<p>Fearon’s “Natural Optimism 2” is one of 59 works on display from as many Bay Area artists in “Abstracting Nature” at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library. The exhibit, which runs Jan. 15-March 11, showcases paintings, drawings and photographs inspired by nature and reinterpreted as abstractions.</p>
<p>An artists’ reception is set for 6-8 p.m. Jan. 15, and a free ARTtalk with environmental artist David Maisel sharing his abstract paintings and photographs is set for 6:30-7:30 p.m. Feb. 19.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Hilary Sessions is a volunteer and board member for Make It Home, which helps furnish homes for those transitioning from being unhoused.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those transitioning out of crisis, obtaining housing can provide much needed stability — but it takes a lot more than a roof over their heads to make a house feel like a home.</p>
<p>“One of the problems, if you have a family or someone that’s really on the edge, if they move into a vacant home and they don’t have any money to spend on furniture or even a bed or a desk or pots and pans, there’s a good chance that they will slip back into the system because they don’t really have a home, they have a place to sleep,” says Strawberry resident Hilary Sessions.</p>
<p>That’s where Make It Home steps in — and where Sessions, 59, has found her calling as both a volunteer and a member of the organization’s board of directors. The Marin-based nonprofit furnishes homes for people in the social-welfare system, building a bridge between federally subsidized Section 8 housing and possessing a true home, an often-overlooked element in preventing recidivism.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon man advocates for youth, the unhoused in volunteer roles</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-man-advocates-for-youth-the-unhoused-in-volunteer-roles</link>
     <description>Longtime Tiburon resident Jim Snipes has been volunteering as a court-appointed special advocate with Marin CASA for about eight years.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jim Snipes first learned about court-appointed special advocates, volunteers who work to support youth in the foster-care system, during a lunchtime presentation at his San Francisco law firm.</p>
<p>He recalls being struck by some of the statistics shared about the risks facing foster youth, including a higher likelihood of ending up unhoused. Court-appointed special advocates, or CASAs, work to change those outcomes by speaking up for the best interests of youth in the courtroom and as the kids move through the child-welfare system.</p>
<p>At the time, Snipes was winding down his three-decade legal career and was looking for ways to get more involved in the community as he entered retirement.</p>
<p>“I thought, ‘This sounds like a great prospect,’“ he recalls.</p>
<p>Snipes, 72, is now in his eighth year volunteering as a court-appointed special advocate with Marin CASA. In his role, the Tiburon resident is assigned to one or two youth in the foster-care or juvenile-justice systems at a time and works to establish a relationship with them, advocating for their fundamental medical, educational and mental-health needs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Madeleine Gillespie&apos;s and Vera Woo&apos;s desires to create change led them to join the Marin County Youth Commission.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local teens Madeleine Gillespie and Vera Woo will spend the next year on the Marin County Youth Commission, which is focusing its work on five topics: mental health, racial equity, disability justice, immigrant justice and alcohol and drug prevention. (Amelia Plumb / For The Ark)</p>
<p>Local teens Madeleine Gillespie and Vera Woo were each looking for a way to get more involved in community issues as they moved through high school.</p>
<p>Madeleine says she’s long been interested in women’s rights and educational rights. She’s participated in some local protests, which she says sparked a desire to continue to speak out against injustice.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to do as much as I could to help the people who, often, their voices are stifled and they don’t have the opportunity to stand up for themselves at times because of the way our society works,” says the Belvedere resident, a junior at Tamalpais High School.</p>
<p>Vera, meanwhile, says growing up Asian American in predominantly white Marin County could be isolating at times and shaped her interest in racial justice, adding that as a person of color, she’s often felt “out of place” among her peers.</p>
<p>“I really just want to get involved and make other people who may be experiencing that to not have to go through the same experience I went through,” says Vera, who attended Reed Union School District schools and is now a sophomore at The Branson School.</p>
<p>Both girls’ desires to create change led them to join the Marin County Youth Commission. They were each appointed to the board in August and will spend the next year working alongside nearly two dozen other teens to learn more about and help tackle some of the county’s most pressing issues, from mental health and racial equity to disability justice, immigrant justice and alcohol and drug prevention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dave Gotz has spent nearly 30 years working and volunteering with the Belvedere-Tiburon Landmarks Society, and in that time he has gained a reputation as a bit of a renaissance man.

     <title>Volunteer’s vision helps transform library gallery into regional arts hub</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/volunteer-s-vision-helps-transform-library-gallery-into-regional-arts-hub</link>
     <description>Diane Green helped user the shift from solo shows of local artists to a juried exhibition venue that draws artists from across the Bay Area.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diane Green had been organizing art exhibits at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library for about a decade by 2019, when construction began on the library’s $18.31 million expansion. The timing seemed right, she says, to step aside from her volunteer role on the art committee and hand off the responsibility.</p>
<p>Then she took a hard-hat tour of the construction site and saw what would become a dedicated gallery space boasting some 65 linear wall feet, with another 35 feet available for display in the hallways.</p>
<p>“I turned the corner and I saw that gallery, and my heart just started thumping,” says Green, 72. “I went, ‘Whoa, I’m not ready to go yet.’”</p>
<p>The Tiburon resident immediately saw the potential to transform the library’s exhibition program.</p>
<p>“Let’s see what kind of quality artists are willing to bring their art over here, and let’s see what kind of conversation comes out of that,” she recalls thinking.</p>
<p>Since the gallery opened as part of the remodeled library in 2022, Green has helped transform the library from hosting solo shows focused on local artists to a highly regarded exhibition venue that draws artists from across the Bay Area for juried shows exploring diverse themes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Longtime Tiburon resident Bill Brinkman, 79, has been a volunteer with Tiburon Peninsula Village for about seven years.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Teri Kuhns says she looks forward to seeing Bill Brinkman every time he fulfills one of her requests through Tiburon Peninsula Village, a group dedicated to helping local residents remain in their homes as they age.</p>
<p>As a volunteer for the group, Brinkman has driven Kuhns, 90, to appointments and helped out with other small tasks around her Belvedere home, including resetting her electric stove when it wouldn’t stop beeping.</p>
<p>But what Kuhns says she enjoys about the visits is not just the help she receives but the camaraderie. She and Brinkman chat, laugh and listen to music, she says, and he feels like a friend.</p>
<p>“We just get to know each other, and it’s in the most wonderful way,” Kuhns says. “These are the kind of people you want for friends, people who donate their time, so you’re in wonderful company.”</p>
<p>Longtime Tiburon resident Brinkman, 79, has been a volunteer with Tiburon Peninsula Village for about seven years now. He typically spends a few hours a week driving area seniors to medical appointments or to run errands. He’ll change light bulbs, make minor plumbing adjustments, assemble furniture and help with other tasks that enable aging residents to feel safe, comfortable and confident at home.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Visitors to Town Hall can step back in time to see what the Tiburon Peninsula looked like 150 years ago, including what stores lined Tiburon’s Main Street and failed plans to build Hygeia, a utopian residential community in town.</p>
<p>Those details and more of life on the peninsula in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are captured in a series of original and reproduced historical maps of Tiburon, Belvedere and the surrounding area on display through Jan. 28 in Town Hall’s downstairs gallery.

     <title>Flooding, outages test Tiburon Peninsula&apos;s preparedness</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/worst-flooding-in-decades-submerges-highway-101-tiburon-peninsula-roads-knocks-out-911</link>
     <description>A four-day deluge of king tides and storms Jan. 1-4 brought the worst coastal flooding to Marin County in nearly three decades.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Note: This article was originally posted Jan. 5 and updated Jan. 8.A four-day deluge of king tides and atmospheric-river storms Jan. 1-4 brought the worst coastal flooding to Marin County in nearly three decades, submerging Highway 101 and local roads while temporarily knocking out 911 service countywide.</p>
<p>But Tiburon and Belvedere officials said their towns were largely spared, experiencing only the typical flooding hot spots along Tiburon Boulevard and downtown Beach Road, plus isolated incidents including a transformer issue in downtown Tiburon and a close call with Beach Road breaching in Belvedere.</p>
<p>In Strawberry, flooding forced Marin sheriff’s deputies to block off the Redwood Highway frontage road from De Silva Island Drive to the Chevron car wash during the peak king tide Jan. 3, as vehicles sitting in at least 2 feet of water were temporarily abandoned in the fully submerged roadway and Seminary Drive park-and-ride.</p>
<p>Tiburon Town Manager Greg Chanis and Public Works Operations Manager Patrick Kerslake said in interviews last week that the peninsula handled the storm well. Besides occasional fallen trees, the area saw only expected flooding at Tiburon Boulevard’s inbound lanes near the 76 gas station, adjacent Greenwood Cove Drive, and at Beach Road downtown.</p>
<p>Inbound boulevard flooding Jan. 3 narrowed traffic to only partial use of the left lane, while at least two vehicles appeared to be abandoned in at least a foot of water along Greenwood Cove Drive. Cars mostly avoided the Beach Road entrance to The Boardwalk shopping center, though full-sized trucks splashed through bumper-deep water.</p>
<p>“The flooding we did experience was predictable,” Chanis said. “The Blackfield intersection is problematic, as is the downtown intersection, but other than that, we weathered the storm pretty well.”</p>
<p>Officials have suggested the flood-prone area at Tiburon Boulevard and Greenwood Cove might only be fixable with a seawall, with considerable multijurisdictional hurdles and expenses. Meanwhile, Tiburon has been upgrading its storm-drain systems.</p>
<p>Belvedere City Manager Robert Zadnik said his city saw no serious wind or rainfall impacts, with Public Works crews spending extra time clearing storm drains, sweeping and monitoring between storms.</p>
<p>Water came within about a foot of breaching onto Beach Road Jan. 3. Zadnik said Belvedere was “very lucky” that rain eased by the time king tides arrived.</p>
