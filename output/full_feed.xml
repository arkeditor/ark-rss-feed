     <title>Belvedere charts 20-year roadmap to keep public assets in shape</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-charts-20-year-roadmap-to-keep-public-assets-in-shape</link>
     <description>The review of every city-owned road, drain, building and retaining wall will forecast what repairs will be needed and what they will cost.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere is undertaking a comprehensive review of every city-owned road, drain, building and retaining wall to create a 20-year forecast of what repairs will be needed and what they will cost.</p>
<p>Two companies have been hired at a total cost of $91,508 to assess facilities and storm drains, while a third is negotiating to assess retaining walls.</p>
<p>City Manager Robert Zadnik announced the plan at the Nov. 10 City Council meeting, saying the effort will help the city manage aging infrastructure before problems become costly emergencies.</p>
<p>The assessments will cover virtually every piece of city-owned infrastructure, from City Hall, which also houses the Community Center and Police Department, to parks including Community Park, Tom Price Park, Centennial Park and Land Co. Park. The city also owns the Public Works Yard, about 30 official and unofficial walking lanes on Belvedere and Corinthian islands, the San Rafael Avenue walking path, visual easements along West Shore Road and all roads and median strips.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Grant helps launch senior-support ‘village’ test at Strawberry complex</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/grant-helps-launch-senior-support-village-test-at-strawberry-complex</link>
     <description>Marin Villages will launch a pilot program at Kruger Pines, where 56 low-income and disabled seniors live in federally subsidized units.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A nonprofit that matches older volunteers with seniors who need help with daily tasks has won $22,500 to test whether its peer-support model can work in affordable housing.</p>
<p>Marin Villages will launch a pilot program in early 2026 at Kruger Pines in Strawberry, where 56 low-income and disabled seniors live in federally subsidized units on North Knoll Road. The Marin Housing Authority, which runs the facility, approached Marin Villages earlier this year.</p>
<p>“They wanted to hear more about our model because they wondered if the same kind of self-help model might work in a public-housing setting,” said John Power, executive director of Marin Villages.</p>
<p>The organization was among 94 groups awarded grants through Marin County’s 2026 Community Grants & Investment Program. Another local recipient, Painted Bins, received $14,000 to produce an environmental education video. The organization, led by Belvedere’s Kathy Huber and associated with Sustainable Marin, places student-art-decorated compost bins in public spaces to promote composting and climate-change awareness.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Legendary ice skater ‘Mr. Debonair’ reflects on career, life at 90</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/legendary-ice-skater-mr-debonair-reflects-on-career-life-at-90</link>
     <description>Hall-of-fame ice skater ‘Mr. Debonair’ Richard Dwyer, a part-time Tiburon resident, turned 90 on Nov. 18.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For over 60 years, Richard Dwyer donned a tuxedo and top hat, skated onto the ice accompanied by a line of performers known as “The Dwyer Girls” and handed roses to audience members in arenas around the world.</p>
<p>The act made him a legend. Olympic champions grew up with his poster on their walls. A president and a governor honored him. Charles M. Schulz name-dropped him in “Peanuts” — twice. He was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Now 90, the part-time Tiburon resident known as “Mr. Debonair” still laces up his skates several times a week, gliding forward and backward with practiced turns for a half-hour at a time. He gave up jumps two years ago, but he’s not ready to give up the ice.</p>
<p>Dwyer celebrated his birthday Nov. 18 with a party in town Nov. 23. A birthday video shared with The Ark featured Olympic figure-skating champions Scott Hamilton and Brian Boitano honoring his legacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tracy Hobie winds white tape around a red velvet rope outside Petite Left Bank on Tiburon Boulevard, creating a candy-cane-like pattern.</p>
<p>Hobie, lead server at the French restaurant, spent Nov. 25 transforming the restaurant’s entrance into a winter wonderland, featuring a fresh Douglas fir tree, white lights, a wooden reindeer, snowflakes and bouquets of roses edged with pine. A snowman in a top hat presides over it all.</p>
<p>The display marks the restaurant’s return to a December tradition: offering free hot chocolate to anyone who walks by.</p>
<p>Though the restaurant was closed that day, kids had already stopped to peer through the window.</p>
<p>“I just really want to bring some cheer for the kids — and really adults too, who get into it like me,” says Hobie, 58. “I love this. This is my favorite part of the holidays, the decorations and the lights and the music.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Garden Plot: A DIY compost pile or worm bin can do wonders</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/garden-plot-a-diy-compost-pile-or-worm-bin-can-do-wonders</link>
     <description>If you have a compost pile or a worm bin, you’re well on your way to creating the amazing product some gardeners call black gold.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have a compost pile or a worm bin, you’re well on your way to creating the amazing product some gardeners call black gold — finished compost rich with nutrients.</p>
<p>You can buy a starter worm bin in stores or online. They vary in price from less than $100 to about $1,700. It’s best to start with something inexpensive and work your way up if you feel inclined to upgrade.</p>
<p>Years ago, my husband made a simple bin out of some old unpainted redwood, but I was not a good worm mother and managed to kill the poor things promptly by not keeping it damp enough. You want it damp, not soaking wet. It’s best to check it every day, and if it seems too wet, add some small pieces of cardboard or shredded brown paper bags to soak up some of the moisture.</p>
<p>You should have a way of capturing any excess liquid that accumulates because that excess is very nutritious for your garden or pots. Commercial bins will likely have a drain so you can catch any runoff.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Friendship Kitchen in Tiburon rallies community against hunger</title>

     <description>The packaged meals were delivered to residents at The Hilarita apartment complex on Ned’s Way and Kruger Pines in Strawberry.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The clatter of knives on cutting boards mixed with laughter and music Nov. 23 as more than 30 volunteers transformed The Ranch’s Dairy Knoll recreation center into a community kitchen, chopping vegetables and rolling meatballs to package 100 meals for local low-income seniors and others in need.</p>
<p>The effort, dubbed The Friendship Kitchen, was organized by Chabad of Tiburon. The packaged meals — meatballs, sauteed veggies and rice — were delivered to residents at The Hilarita apartment complex on Ned’s Way and Kruger Pines in Strawberry, said Mirel Mintz of Chabad of Tiburon, who headed the event with her husband, Rabbi Levi Mintz.</p>
<p>The Friendship Kitchen extends Chabad of Tiburon’s Friendship Circle project, which pairs teens with children who have special needs.</p>
<p>Chabad of Tiburon organized the volunteer day after Levi Mintz said he learned some seniors could not cook meals or “be able to necessarily take care of themselves.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon bike lanes pushed to 2029 as Caltrans proceeds along rest of corridor</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-bike-lanes-pushed-to-2029-as-caltrans-proceeds-along-rest-of-corridor</link>
     <description>The Phase 1 start date hinges on Tiburon first completing a separate project to install underground conduit for fiber-optic cables along the boulevard.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caltrans has confirmed it will pursue Tiburon Boulevard bike lanes within town limits in a second phase of improvements — with funding to be secured next year and construction targeted for early 2029 — as the final design is now complete for its 4.6-mile Mill Valley-to-Tiburon pavement project set to start next summer.</p>
<p>The Phase 1 start date hinges on Tiburon first completing a separate project to install underground conduit for fiber-optic cables along the boulevard, agency spokesperson Matt O’Donnell said. The town took on the work after Caltrans considered adding it to the maintenance project but ultimately deferred.</p>
<p>The Caltrans improvements along state-owned Highway 131, which doubles as East Blithedale Avenue in Mill Valley and as Tiburon Boulevard east of the southbound Highway 101 on-ramp, are expected to take a year, wrapping in summer 2027. They include repaving, drainage upgrades, guardrails, curb ramps, signs, traffic signals, lighting, crosswalks and intersection improvements. The California Transportation Commission in October allocated $18.57 million toward the work, though Matt O’Donnell said construction costs would be closer to $15.2 million.</p>
<p>Phase 2 would include a stakeholder task force “to provide inclusive community input and develop an endorsed scope and configuration for bikeway and transit improvements,” O’Donnell said.</p>
<p>Caltrans, the county and Southern Marin Supervisor Stephanie Moulton-Peters are coordinating to select a task-force facilitator, O’Donnell said, as the agency looks to “finalize task-force membership and convene the group in early 2026.”</p>
<p>New lanes coming to Mill Valley, unincorporated areas</p>
<p>Caltrans will, however, proceed with creating new Class 2 bike lanes on both sides of the road in Mill Valley, Strawberry and unincorporated Tiburon, starting from Mill Valley’s Tower Road-East Blithedale intersection. The lanes will run along the Highway 101 overpass, becoming Class 4 protected bikeways on Tiburon Boulevard at South Knoll Road and North Knoll Road before ending at Blackfield Drive.</p>
<p>On the south side, a temporary Class 1 multiuse path — with a permanent path to follow in Phase 2 — will be created between Strawberry and Blackfield drives. That path leads to the existing Class 3 bike route along Greenwood Cove Drive and Greenwood Beach Road, where residents have long complained about bike traffic and have sought to redirect faster cyclists out to Tiburon Boulevard...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>“The Sky Whales” features three whales painted in light blues and pinks swimming, or flying, through a pink sky with a full moon alongside pelicans and egrets.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Rachel Hébert, raising kids in Marin meant being a frequent shopper at the Trader Joe’s in Greenbrae. Getting there meant driving through the Wornum Drive underpass at Highway 101. Each trip, she’d eye the massive gray wall.</p>
<p>“I just had this idea that that big, blank gray wall should be something else,” she said.</p>
<p>So the Tiburon resident, a professional muralist and artist, took matters into her own hands and last month completed a 100-foot-long, 11-foot-tall mural spanning the southern length of the underpass.</p>
<p>“The Sky Whales” features three whales painted in light blues and pinks swimming, or flying, through a pink sky with a full moon alongside pelicans and egrets.</p>
<p>The mural took about a month to paint, but it followed a three-year process that involved getting approvals from Caltrans, which owns the wall that is also load-bearing for the highway that travels over it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon residents looking to build tiny homes will soon face fewer regulatory hurdles under building-code updates the Town Council approved Nov. 19.</p>
<p>The council voted 4-0, with Councilmember Isaac Nikfar absent, to adopt changes from the 2025 state building code. The updates also reaffirm earlier-approved rules for electric-vehicle charging readiness and stricter energy-efficiency standards. A second vote takes place Dec. 3, and the changes take effect 30 days later.</p>
<p>The most substantial update is “more flexible regulations for what are considered tiny homes,” interim Community Development Director Neal Toft said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A musician leaves tech to help others build connections</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-musician-leaves-tech-to-help-others-build-connections</link>
     <description>Kedar Shashidhar worked in social media, virtual reality and artificial intelligence but recently left tech to become a life coach.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The melodic sounds of the Hanuman Chalisa, a Hindu devotional hymn, fills The Boardwalk shopping center Nov. 18. The chant, singer Kedar Shashidhar says, praises Hanuman, the Hindu deity depicted as a monkey, and his “strength, vitality and courage.”</p>
<p>“I’m in a moment in the chapter where I’m like, ‘OK, yeah, I’m calling in that kind of strength, a brightness, as I meet the world,” Shashidhar says.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old Tiburon resident previously worked in social media, virtual reality and artificial intelligence but recently left tech to become a life coach as The Relational Accelerator. His goal, he says, is to “help people build meaningful relationships both professionally and in their deeper world.”</p>
<p>He made the career switch after realizing the technology he was developing “was actually pulling people apart rather than bringing people together, despite it saying that it was bringing people together.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Belvedere Community Foundation photo contest winners Joyce Bell-Albert, Eileen Bowen, Alice Lando, Joanne Norman, Mary Kathryn Rice and Feisal Siddiqi of Tiburon were honored Nov. 20.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The winning snapshots in this year’s Belvedere Community Foundation photo contest captured everyday life on the peninsula, from birds floating over San Francisco Bay to a supermoon suspended between two trees to a quiet walk along a flower-lined path.</p>
<p>The standout images were selected from about 100 entries, with first-place prizes awarded in six categories: architecture, black and white, landscapes, people, sunrise/sunset and wildlife. A seventh category for photographers ages 5-18 drew no entries.</p>

     <title>Belvedere OKs housing plan, zoning overhaul for state approval</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-oks-housing-plan-zoning-overhaul-for-state-approval</link>
     <description>The votes effectively end nearly four years of work to bring the city into compliance with state housing requirements.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belvedere City Council unanimously approved a package of housing reforms Nov. 10, effectively ending nearly four years of work to bring the city into compliance with state requirements to accommodate at least 160 new housing units.</p>
<p>Officials voted to formally adopt the state-mandated 2023-2031 housing element and, in a separate vote, approved a set of zoning amendments that will allow for new development under the eight-year roadmap.</p>
<p>The California Department of Housing and Community Development indicated in July that revisions in the fourth draft of the element — which was required to be in place by Jan. 31, 2023 — would comply with state law but, because the city missed several implementation deadlines, the element could not be certified until the zoning amendments are in place.</p>
<p>The City Council is expected to formally adopt those amendments in a required second vote Dec. 8, after which Belvedere will submit both documents to Sacramento for review and certification.</p>
<p>The changes address affordable-housing requirements and incentives, streamlined approvals for developments with at least 20% affordable units, updated design and development standards, mixed-use housing, emergency shelters, parking and reasonable-accommodation requests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere shifting coyote reporting to Marin Humane</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-shifting-coyote-reporting-to-marin-humane</link>
     <description>Since 2023, at least five dogs and four cats have been killed by coyotes, and seven other pets have been injured, according to reports received by the city.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere residents will soon report coyote sightings to Marin Humane rather than the city under a new agreement that will maintain most of the response services residents have received for the past two years.</p>
<p>The city already pays the nonprofit $25,000 annually, its share of an agreement with Marin County to provide animal-control services to cities and towns countywide. It will now pay an additional $7,800 per year for a separate coyote-focused contract that will handle all coyote-related incidents, including receiving reports about local coyote sightings and interactions. The arrangement represents a slight savings over the $8,000 the city has been paying consultant Rebecca Dmytryk annually since 2023.</p>
<p>The agreement, set to be finalized by the end of the month, signals a shift in strategy for Belvedere, which contracted with Dmytryk of Humane Wildlife Control to create a comprehensive coyote-management plan and evaluate coyote-denning behavior. During that time, the city received and tracked reports directly through a dedicated hotline and web submission form, and officials worked with Dmytryk to respond to incidents when necessary.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere homeowners face $2,928 fee to exit historic designation</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-homeowners-face-2-928-fee-to-exit-historic-designation</link>
     <description>Belvedere residents who missed out on the Mills Act tax-incentive program can get $366 streamlined removal.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere homeowners who want out of the city’s historic designation program must pay $2,928 and navigate a multistep approval process under fees the City Council unanimously approved Nov. 10.</p>
<p>The council offered a break to five homeowners caught in limbo when the city ended its Mills Act program. Those who won historic designation between June 1, 2021, and May 1, 2024, but never received the program’s property-tax breaks, can apply for streamlined removal by Feb. 13 and pay just $366.</p>
<p>Both fees took effect immediately.</p>
<p>The vote put the finishing touches on an ordinance the council adopted in October that creates the first formal pathway for property owners to exit the program. Some 30 homes in Belvedere hold historic designation.</p>
<p>To be removed, homeowners must pay the fee, submit an application explaining why decertification is warranted, win approval from the Historic Preservation Committee and earn final sign-off from the City Council.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Reality TV pilot spotlights Cinelounge Tiburon owners’ fight to save movie theaters</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reality-tv-pilot-spotlights-cinelounge-tiburon-owners-fight-to-save-movie-theaters</link>
     <description>Mill Valley’s Alexandra Duparc filmed Christian and Camilla Meoli for the “Saving Cinema” pilot in October.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A director who co-wrote a $34 million Netflix legal drama has turned her camera on downtown Tiburon’s Cinelounge, filming a reality TV pilot about the theater’s husband-and-wife owners and their mission to save the moviegoing experience.</p>
<p>Mill Valley’s Alexandra Duparc filmed Christian and Camilla Meoli for the “Saving Cinema” pilot Oct. 26-27. She is still shopping the show, which blends reality footage with scripted elements, to streaming services.</p>
<p>Duparc previously co-wrote “Monsanto,” a yet-to-be filmed legal drama with “The Blind Side” director John Lee Hancock, who is directing “Monsanto.” The film is set to star Glen Powell, Anthony Mackie and Laura Dern.</p>
<p>Friends and associates encouraged Duparc to meet the Meolis. The instant connection led her to assist with Cinelounge’s fundraising efforts as the theater works to transition to a nonprofit. She also began managing its social media.</p>
<p>“Then in doing that, I think I just felt deeply more in love with all of it and went like, ‘You know, I think that the world needs to know that these kinds of things are happening because for something that’s such a dying business, there’s not very many people holding the net to save anyone,’” Duparc says. “And it’s kind of freaking me out.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon council will review traffic study in January following delays</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-council-will-review-traffic-study-in-january-following-delays</link>
     <description>The consultant attributed the delays to Caltrans taking additional time to finalize its 4.6-mile preventive-maintenance project of Tiburon Boulevard.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Initial findings from Tiburon’s traffic study are now expected to be presented to the Town Council in January, some seven months later than the original target date. The consultant in charge of the project has attributed the delays to Caltrans taking additional time to finalize its 4.6-mile preventive-maintenance project of Tiburon Boulevard set to begin next summer.</p>
<p>Representatives from Parametrix, the firm hired by the town to complete the traffic study, previously said they hoped to have results to present to the town in June. However, the firm had to slow down its work as Caltrans, which is responsible for maintaining Tiburon Boulevard as State Route 131, weighed the details of its preventative-maintenance projects, including whether to include controversial bike lanes along Tiburon Boulevard from Trestle Glen Boulevard to Blackfield Drive and if it could incorporate Tiburon’s plans to install conduit that could carry fiber-optic cables, Public Works engineering manager David Eshoo said Nov. 14.</p>]]></content:encoded>
