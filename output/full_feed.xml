     <title>Strawberry neighbors still see red flags in seminary-site plan</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-neighbors-still-see-red-flags-in-seminary-site-plan</link>
     <description>Neighbors say the final EIR proves the project is too large — with one attorney threatening legal action if changes aren’t made.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three environmental impacts from the proposed 336-unit redevelopment of the former Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary in Strawberry cannot be avoided, according to a final county review that neighbors say proves the project is too large — with one attorney calling it “an entire new city on a hill” and threatening legal action if changes aren’t made.</p>
<p>The 684-page environmental report, released by Marin County Dec. 12, identifies traffic, greenhouse-gas emissions and construction noise as significant impacts that cannot be fully mitigated. The document also cites nine additional significant impacts that county officials say can be reduced to less-than-significant levels if all proposed measures work as planned.</p>
<p>The county has opened a 45-day public comment period that ends at 4 p.m. Jan. 26.</p>
<p>Seminary Neighborhood Association attorney Riley Hurd said the identified impacts — 13 in total — should give county supervisors pause.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, that’s 13 significant environmental impacts from this project,” Hurd said. “Environmental review is supposed to inform decision-makers about the environmental impacts of projects … so that they can make an educated vote. Here, the information is out. And it is telling the Board of Supervisors that if you were to proceed with this project as currently designed, it will be extremely impactful.”</p>
<p>The 127-acre project at 201 Seminary Drive would transform the site into a mixed-use development with 336 single- and multifamily residential units — including 70 affordable units — and a 150-unit senior residential-care facility. The project also includes a 17,000-square-foot fitness center and a 3,000-square-foot preschool, both open to the public. While more than 70% of the campus would remain as open space, athletic fields, paths and plazas, the project would add about 530 new residents and about 250 new workers at full build-out.</p>
<p>Developer North Coast Land Holdings LLC also proposes maintaining an academic campus for up to 1,000 students under an existing 1953 conditional use permit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Reed board wants more public input on $115M school bond</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-board-wants-more-public-input-on-115m-school-bond</link>
     <description>Survey results show approval is “viable” but far from a sure thing.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An early survey of Reed Union School District voters revealed tentative support for a $115-million facilities bond measure, but board members want more community feedback before they decide whether to place the initiative on the November ballot.</p>
<p>A poll of 223 district voters likely to vote in the Nov. 3, 2026, election found 62% would support the proposed bond without any additional information about the tax measure or the district. That number rose to about 65% after voters were given educational statements about the bond measure but declined to about 59% after an exchange of educational statements and negative messaging, according to Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz & Associates, or FM3, the research firm hired to conduct the survey.</p>
<p>The poll had a 6.6% margin of error. The bond measure would need 55% voter approval to pass.</p>
<p>The results show approval is “viable” but far from a sure thing, Richard Bernard, a partner at FM3, told board members at their Dec. 15 meeting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere agrees to pay $50k to settle lawsuit over construction time penalty</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-agrees-to-pay-50k-to-settle-lawsuit-over-construction-time-penalty</link>
     <description>The $254,400 penalty remains final while the $50,000 represents new settlement consideration rather than a refund or reimbursement.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere is paying $50,000 to settle a federal lawsuit challenging a Eucalyptus Road homeowner’s construction time-limit penalty, ending a legal battle that cost the city another $82,500 in attorney fees to litigate.</p>
<p>Laurent and Marguerite Lefouet filed suit in U.S. District Court in April after the City Council upheld a $254,400 penalty for a renovation that ran 257 days past its deadline. The couple paid the fine in February but argued it violated constitutional protections against excessive fines and denial of due process.</p>
<p>They reached a no-fault settlement in November that dismisses the lawsuit with prejudice and includes mutual releases, City Manager Robert Zadnik said. Court records show the case was dismissed Dec. 3, and Zadnik said details were being finalized last week.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the penalty amount remains final while the $50,000 represents new settlement consideration rather than a refund or reimbursement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Shari Meads stepped into the role of community development director at Town Hall Dec. 8, taking over for Dina Tasini.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former registered nurse who became a city planner is now leading Tiburon’s planning and building divisions, bringing experience in housing policy, climate planning and wildfire recovery to a position that’s been vacant since June.</p>

     <title>Point Tiburon Plaza coffee cart gets initial approval from town</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/point-tiburon-plaza-coffee-cart-gets-initial-approval-from-town</link>
     <description>The owners must provide more details on wastewater disposal, visual screening and operations before receiving formal approval.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A coffee cart proposed for Point Tiburon Plaza won preliminary support from planning officials Dec. 9, but owners must provide more details on wastewater disposal, visual screening and operations before receiving formal approval.</p>
<p>The Tiburon Planning Commission voted 4-0, with Commissioner Jeff Tsai absent, to continue the item while directing staff to prepare a resolution approving the conditional use permit. Commissioners told town staff to work with Paradise Coffee owners Samuel Cook and Juan Carlos Caamal to address how the business will discard wastewater, cover the trailer’s hitch and wheels during operations and manage sidewalk access for deliveries.</p>
<p>The 18-foot-by-10-foot trailer is already sitting on the grass between the Marin Transit bus stop and the plaza’s flower-shop gazebo at 1775 Tiburon Blvd. It would operate 6 a.m.-4 p.m. daily with no more than three workers, offering premade pastries, sandwiches and coffee drinks. The trailer would draw electricity from the nearby gazebo.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere cuts deal to leave Artist’s View mostly untouched until 2043</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-cuts-deal-to-leave-artist-s-view-mostly-untouched-until-2043</link>
     <description>The 2043 end date ties to a restriction placed on the property 57 years ago, when Feb. 20, 1968, deed imposed 75-year limits on its use and public access.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In exchange for not opposing a small viewing deck, two Belvedere homeowners have secured the city’s promise to leave the rest of Artist’s View untouched until 2043 — a date tied to the property’s murky legal history.</p>
<p>The City Council voted unanimously Dec. 8 to approve the agreement with Michael Davis and Jyll Johnstone, who own the property at 475 Belvedere Ave. adjacent to the city-owned open space at the southern end of Belvedere Island. No discussion was held.</p>
<p>The deal resolves a standoff over the July 15 Planning Commission approval of a much-debated viewing deck. After six years of proposals that included trails to the property’s rocky beach, officials settled on a 10.5-foot-deep and 16-foot-wide platform oriented toward Angel Island, expected to go out for bid later this spring.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Davis and Johnstone will not oppose the deck’s construction through legal claims or litigation. In exchange, Belvedere commits to build nothing else on the site — no structures, paths, trails, huts or hardscape — until at least Feb. 20, 2043, roughly 17 years. Routine vegetation maintenance and safety work remain allowed.</p>
<p>The city has until Sept. 1, 2028, to build the platform. The agreement becomes void if the city misses the deadline, freeing Davis and Johnstone to challenge future development.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Reed schools line up new meal provider after vendor’s sudden exit</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-schools-line-up-new-meal-provider-after-vendor-s-sudden-exit</link>
     <description>The announcement forced the district to scramble to secure a new vendor for the rest of the school year.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Reed Union School District has quickly pivoted to a new vendor for its free breakfast and lunch program after its current provider said it could no longer continue service in the new year.</p>
<p>San Lorenzo-based Revolution Foods will begin serving meals to Reed district students Jan. 6, their first day back from winter break, ensuring no disruption to the free meal program despite the abrupt vendor change.</p>
<p>Local catering company Dee’s Organics, which has been serving meals to students at all three Reed district campuses since August, recently informed the district it would need to “step away from public-school food-service contracts,” Superintendent Kimberly McGrath said in a December newsletter to parents. The company said its final meal service would be Dec. 19, the last day of school before winter break.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>The board has 60 days to decide whether to appoint someone to serve the remainder of her term or call for a special election.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Longtime Reed Union School District board member Sherry Wangenheim is resigning from her position one year before her term expires, creating an immediate vacancy on the five-member board.</p>
<p>Wangenheim and her family are moving to London. She announced her resignation, effective Dec. 31, at the board’s Dec. 15 meeting.</p>
<p>In a Dec. 16 email, Wangenheim said her husband, Aaron, accepted a new job in London and has been commuting back and forth as their two youngest kids finish their school years. The family plans to relocate in June, but Wangenheim said she will need to take several trips to London before then to help get things settled.</p>
<p>The board has 60 days from the date of Wangenheim’s resignation to decide whether to appoint someone to serve the remainder of her term, which runs through November 2026, or call for a special election. Whoever takes over for Wangenheim can then choose to run for a full four-year term in the Nov. 3, 2026, general election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Parks board: Think bigger and place them in more prominent locations around town.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon parks officials have given preliminary approval to public-art street signs featuring encouraging messages — with a directive to think bigger and place them in more prominent locations around town.</p>
<p>The Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission told Heritage and Arts Commission representatives Dec. 8 to revise their pursuit of Scott Froschauer’s “Word on the Street” project by incorporating signs in more visible areas, such as the Tiburon ferry landing, Blackie’s Pasture or atop the knoll that separates McKegney Green from South of the Knoll Park.</p>
<p>The vote of support and directive was 4-0, with Commissioner Liz Judge absent. The parks board asked arts commissioners to return with a revised proposal for formal approval before a Town Council vote, which arts board Chair Arjun Gupta said he was targeting for March to get the exhibit up later in the spring.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After seeing Tiburon posts on her social-media feed, San Francisco resident Jillian Chin decided to stop scrolling and take a day trip with her boyfriend, Eddie Kim.</p>
<p>The couple had lunch Dec. 16 at Salt & Pepper on Main Street and planned to catch Cinelounge’s Tuesday weekly $5 “mystery movie” screening later that afternoon, where the film isn’t revealed to audiences until showtime.</p>
<p>Chin, 21, said she hoped they could also hike to the Hippie Tree and browse downtown storefronts.</p>
<p>She and Kim, 22, met while attending the University of California at Davis and have been dating for about six months. Chin graduated in the fall with a bachelor’s in political science and is now studying for the Law School Admission Test while working for a firm specializing in personal-injury cases. She says she hopes to attend law school in state, though she’s still figuring out which area of law to pursue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Neighbor rallies support for seniors at Kruger Pines</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/neighbor-rallies-support-for-seniors-at-kruger-pines</link>
     <description>Randy Chase, a longtime political organizer and construction laborer who moved into Kruger Pines about six weeks ago, is launching an “Adopt-A-Senior” program.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the outside, Kruger Pines looks like just another low-slung apartment complex tucked into a comfortable Strawberry neighborhood on North Knoll Road. Inside, 62-year-old resident Randy Chase sees something very different: 56 seniors and disabled tenants at risk of slipping through the cracks — and a community just outside their front door that, he believes, has the power to catch them.</p>
<p>Chase, a longtime political organizer and construction laborer who moved into Kruger Pines about six weeks ago, is launching an “Adopt-A-Senior” program aimed at connecting local volunteers with residents in need of simple, consistent help: a weekly ride to the grocery store, someone to sit and have a cup of coffee while a neighbor shops, a steady friendly face who shows up when they say they will.</p>
<p>He planned to hold an initial gathering Dec. 23, after The Ark’s press time, inviting volunteers from throughout Marin to meet residents over refreshments at the Kruger Pines community room and figure out who needs what.</p>
<p>Chase’s urgency stems from fears about upcoming political changes. In a Nov. 29 Nextdoor post, he cited a change in federal homelessness funding announced in November by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The department released its funding opportunities for the Continuum of Care, stating that only 30% of the $3.9 billion in funding would be authorized for permanent housing or rental aid — potentially resulting in Marin County losing $3.5 million of its funding for permanent housing. As a result, 220 Marin residents, most over 50, are at risk of losing their housing security.</p>
<p>“These are people who finally escaped the streets. Now they’re being put right back on the edge. This isn’t theory. It’s not partisan noise. It’s real lives in real apartments — including the seniors in Kruger Pines,” Chase wrote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>County approves Strawberry senior-care facility with conditions</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/county-approves-strawberry-senior-care-facility-with-conditions</link>
     <description>Marin County approved a 106-unit senior-care facility in Strawberry on Dec. 23.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marin County approved a 106-unit senior-care facility in Strawberry on Dec. 23, resolving code inconsistencies identified earlier this month and clearing the way for construction at 100 Thomas Place.</p>
<p>The Community Development Agency granted ministerial approval to Spirit Living Group for a five-story, 150,655-square-foot residential care facility on a 6.6-acre site formerly addressed as 70 N. Knoll Road.</p>
<p>The project includes 71 apartments with kitchens for independent living and 35 assisted living and memory care suites without cooking facilities. A subterranean garage will provide 72 parking spaces. The building will reach 63 feet, 6 inches in height and include common areas with dining rooms, activity spaces, a theater, salon, library and fitness facilities.</p>
<p>The county’s Dec. 6 consistency analysis had identified multiple code inconsistencies, including issues with sidewalk requirements and civic space standards. Spirit Living addressed those concerns through design modifications and waiver requests under the state density bonus law.</p>
<p>The approval comes with extensive conditions requiring the developer to design a private access road with sidewalks connecting to Thomas Drive, relocate utility easements, submit a construction management plan and meet stormwater control requirements. The county also mandates that residents, employees and visitors avoid accessing the site via North Knoll Road.</p>
<p>Spirit Living must pay a $3.73 million jobs/housing linkage fee, at $24.81 per square foot, before permit issuance. The fee addresses the demand for affordable housing created by employment growth from the facility.</p>
<p>The entire facility will operate as a state-licensed residential-care facility for the elderly, subject to yearly inspections and special construction requirements including noncombustible materials and 24-hour monitoring systems. All residents will receive three meals daily, housekeeping, laundry, transportation and wellness programs.</p>
<p>Spirit Living can now apply for building permits. Final occupancy requires authorization from the Southern Marin Fire Protection District, which previously approved alternative fire safety measures including increased sprinkler density and additional standpipe connections.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p>

<p>The 127-acre project at 201 Seminary Drive would transform the site into a mixed-use development with 336 single- and multifamily residential units — including 70 affordable units — and a 150-unit senior residential-care facility. The project also includes a 17,000-square-foot fitness center and a 3,000-square-foot preschool, both open to the public. While more than 70% of the campus would remain as open space, athletic fields, paths and plazas, the project would add about 530 new residents and about 250 new workers.</p>
<p>Developer North Coast Land Holdings LLC also proposes maintaining the academic campus for up to 1,000 students under an existing 1953 conditional use permit.</p>
<p>The 684-page environmental review, released Dec. 12, identifies three significant impacts that cannot be fully mitigated: vehicle miles traveled, greenhouse-gas emissions and construction noise.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Review cites gaps in 106-unit Strawberry senior-care plan as clock ticks</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/review-cites-gaps-in-106-unit-strawberry-senior-care-plan-as-clock-ticks</link>
     <description>Inconsistencies must be resolved by early January, though developers say the setback is routine and will not derail the project.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A proposed 106-unit senior-care facility on Strawberry’s North Knoll Road faces code inconsistencies that must be resolved by early January, though developers say the setback is routine and will not derail the project.</p>
<p>The Marin Community Development Agency completed a required 30-day consistency analysis and, as of Dec. 6, found the 70 N. Knoll Road project inconsistent with multiple development standards. Senior Planner Megan Alton confirmed the analysis was sent to the developers, San Anselmo-based Spirit Living Group, who must address the inconsistencies or apply for waivers by Jan. 4.</p>
<p>The county must issue a decision by that date approving or denying the project in its entirety. Because the proposal is undergoing ministerial review, the decision is not appealable. A denial would require the developers to revise and resubmit their application, while an approval would allow Spirit Living to apply for building permits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon to explore Bramble Beach for kayak launch</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-to-explore-bramble-beach-for-kayak-launch</link>
     <description>While Bramble Beach is being evaluated for the first time, the launch has been a longtime desire of residents and officials.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a decade of false starts, Tiburon is taking another run at creating a stand-up paddleboard and kayak launch on Richardson Bay — this time at a small beach near the Belvedere border that town officials say will be difficult to pull off.</p>
<p>The Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission voted 4-0 Dec. 8 to have town staff explore options for a launch at Bramble Beach, located just off San Rafael Avenue and Tiburon Boulevard. Commissioner Liz Judge was absent.</p>
<p>While Bramble Beach is being evaluated for the first time, the launch has been a longtime desire of residents and officials. The Town Council first explored placing one along Shoreline Park in downtown Tiburon in 2015, but the idea fizzled when officials determined there were limited options for safe entry because of tidal action and ferry traffic.</p>
<p>In a 2023 survey for the town’s parks master plan, 39% of respondents wanted a kayak and paddleboard launch — the sixth-highest priority — and when asked where to invest resources, a launch site ranked No. 1. In 2015, the estimated construction cost was $125,000. Current values would increase construction by 30%-40%, not including contingencies, putting the cost at roughly $162,500 to $175,000.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>The Tiburon Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission will explore whether it can place a paddlecraft launch site at Bramble Beach, which borders Belvedere at San Rafael Avenue off Tiburon Boulevard, as seen Dec. 10. Officials have acknowledged various factors that could make this site difficult to pursue, primarily a lack of parking. (Francisco Martinez / The Ark)</media:description>

     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-submits-fifth-draft-housing-element-to-state-for-final-approval</link>
     <description>The element, which was due Jan. 31, 2023, establishes a roadmap for accommodating at least 160 housing units required under state law.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere submitted its long-awaited housing element to Sacramento on Dec. 11, marking a potential end to nearly three years of noncompliance with state housing mandates.</p>
<p>Planning Director Rebecca Markwick said the city sent both clean and redlined versions of the fifth draft to the California Department of Housing and Community Development, which has 60 days to issue a final determination. The element, which was due Jan. 31, 2023, establishes a roadmap for accommodating at least 160 housing units required under state law.</p>
<p>The submission follows a Nov. 10 City Council vote to adopt the state-mandated 2023-2031 housing element and approve zoning amendments enabling new development under the eight-year plan. The council formally adopted the zoning changes in a required second vote Dec. 8.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere hires officer, filling fifth position in long-understaffed force</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-hires-officer-filling-fifth-position-in-long-understaffed-force</link>
     <description>Tyler Preston, a patrol officer since 2023 with the Mill Valley Police Department, will start Jan. 4.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belvedere Police Department has hired a new officer after months of four-officer staffing left patrol working 12-hour shifts and overtime.</p>
<p>Tyler Preston, a patrol officer since 2023 with the Mill Valley Police Department, will start as Belvedere’s newest police officer Jan. 4, Chief Jason Wu announced in a statement. Hiring Preston at $104,484 annually brings the department to five patrol officers, what officials call “manageable” and one below “ideal.”</p>
<p>The opening came after Sgt. Tom Sabido announced his retirement effective in September, freeing a position tied up by his medical leave.</p>
<p>Operating with only four officers forced the department to rely on long shifts, schedule adjustments and part-time officers to maintain 24-hour coverage, with support from the Tiburon Police Department during extended absences.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Tiburon ferry riders will gain improved service flexibility under a $118 million Golden Gate Ferry fleet modernization program.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon ferry riders will gain improved service flexibility under a $118 million fleet modernization program approved by Golden Gate Ferry’s board.</p>
<p>The district awarded a $92.4 million contract to Mavrik Marine Inc., a Washington-state shipbuilder, to construct two new vessels that will launch an eight-year replacement effort.</p>
<p>Currently, only half of the agency’s four high-speed catamarans can dock at Tiburon and Sausalito because of design differences among the boats. The new standardized fleet will eliminate that constraint, allowing any vessel to serve any route.</p>]]></content:encoded>
