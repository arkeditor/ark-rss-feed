      <description>Stanley Wong is leading growing after-school programs across Marin and the North Bay.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tiburon resident Stanley Wong observes the eight kids gathered in a classroom at Valle­cito Elementary School in San Rafael on a recent Friday afternoon. The kids are there for an after-school chess class, and they’re learning about castling, the special move where the king and rook simultaneously move along the same rank to bring the rook into action while protecting the king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students raise their hands eagerly when they have questions and ideas, with some running up to the board to tell their instructor, Terra Linda resident Leo Maso, what they would do in each scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wong, the 19-year-old executive director of , says he enjoys seeing the students’ enthusiasm to learn the game, which he says teaches kids larger problem-solving skills, as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Tiburon poet finds healing through verse</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-poet-finds-healing-through-verse</link>
      <description>Ashley Moyo uses the spoken word to process grief, identity and life as part of African diaspora.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ashley Moyo wrote her first poem at age 9 for a school assignment about glasses. She continued using poetry throughout her education, including as a Model United Nations member in high school, when she began her speeches with poems rather than quotes or statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I saw that (poems) had a huge impact, like I could hold the crowd in that in those moments,” Moyo says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tiburon resident says she began taking poetry seriously in 2018 during her senior year of high school after sharing one of her poems at an interactive theater show. The director reached out afterward and asked if she wanted to try slam poetry, a type of competition where poets perform original work before a live audience and judges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <description>Reed schools grad Samantha Riley won an invitation to the National Team Selection Camp.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Samantha Riley , a 15-year-old water polo athlete and former Reed Union School District student, has dreams of becoming an Olympian. Now she’s training to be one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redwood High School freshman won a spot at the invitation-only National Team Selection Camp April 25-27 in Orange County after her Olympic Development Program age-group team placed seventh at the national championships last month. The camp will evaluate 75 athletes in her age group, with 16 advancing to compete in the international Pan American Games this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riley attended the selection camp in 2023 but has yet to compete in the games. Athletes at the camp will develop various water polo skills before participating in a tournament on the final day, she said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <description>The theater owner's complaint says the operator of the Rafael, Sequoia and Mill Valley Film Fest is hurting his business.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cinelounge co-founder Christian Meoli is accusing the California Film Institute of “unfair and bullying tactics” for enforcing what he says are three-week exclusivity agreements with art house and specialty film distributors that prevent the downtown Tiburon theater from showing certain movies upon release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meoli on April 3 filed a claim with the Independent Theater Owners Coalition, an arm of the Cinema United trade organization, to end the exclusivity practices and is weighing his legal options, including potentially filing an antitrust claim.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tiburon Mayor Holli Thier will join the crowded 2026 contest to replace Damon Connolly in the California State Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thier, who is in the first year of her third term on the Town Council, announced last week she intended to run for the District 12 seat, which covers all of Marin County and nearly half of Sonoma County, including Petaluma, Rohnert Park and Cotati.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connolly, D-San Rafael, was elected in 2022 and has announced his campaign to replace President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, D-Healdsburg, in the state Senate, as McGuire terms out next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thier confirmed her candidacy to The Ark in an April 11 email, citing issues such as the rising cost of living, insurance companies not writing policies for California homeowners and a need for “strong advocates … who can protect our residents against the dismantling of our democracy” with President Donald Trump in office for a second term.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <description>Mark Marsella played baseball from age 6 through high school.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mark Marsella stands beside his 3-year-old daughter Giani, watching as son Troy steps up to bat for the Tiburon Peninsula Little League’s Yankees during an afternoon game against the Diamondbacks April 15 at the Strawberry Recreation District field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Troy, 11, makes it to first base, Marsella smiles with satisfaction. The Tiburon Peninsula Little League president says Giani often accompanies him to games and is learning about baseball through observation. He plans to involve her in softball when she’s old enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s fun,” Marsella, 43, says about Little League. “They play because they love it. The best part is seeing all the kids have a great time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsella says he appreciates the parental involvement in the league.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Mill Valley principal tapped to lead Reed Elementary School</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/mill-valley-principal-tapped-to-lead-reed-elementary-school</link>
      <description>Aubrey O’Connor is the new Reed Elementary School principal, replacing Mary Niesyn, who is retiring.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A longtime teacher and administrator in the Mill Valley School District has been named the next principal at Reed Elementary School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aubrey O’Connor, the current principal at Park Elementary School, will join the Reed Union School District July 1, with a starting annual salary of $200,000. Her hiring was approved by a 4-0 vote of the district board at its April 15 meeting; the item was included in the district’s personnel report as part of the board’s consent agenda, reserved for bulk approval of items deemed noncontroversial. Board member Afsaneh Zolfaghari was absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’Connor was chosen among seven applicants interviewed to replace Mary Niesyn, who is retiring after a 21-year career at the school that saw her serve as a second-grade teacher and assistant principal before assuming the top job in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Angel Island exhibit looks at border surveillance technology</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/angel-island-exhibit-looks-at-border-surveillance-technology</link>
      <description>“Border Surveillance: Places, People and Technology” features panels detailing technologies used to monitor border crossings — from aerostats and drones to fixed cameras and ground sensors.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visitors to the Angel Island Immigration Museum can explore a new temporary exhibit examining border-surveillance technology through May 25 , thanks to a collaboration with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Border Surveillance: Places, People and Technology,” which opened April 2 at the museum on Angel Island State Park in Tiburon, features panels detailing technologies used to monitor border crossings — from aerostats and drones to fixed cameras and ground sensors. The exhibit also explores emerging surveillance methods, including augmented reality and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Tepporn, executive director of the Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation that oversees the museum, said that while the digital-privacy nonprofit developed the exhibit independently, he was proud the museum serves as its inaugural venue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Sani 5 OKs $3-mil rehab of aging Cove Road pump station</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/sani-5-oks-3-mil-rehab-of-aging-cove-road-pump-station</link>
      <description>Construction is targeted for spring 2026 because it will take up to a year to obtain one of the necessary parts for the upgrade.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Sanitary District No. 5 of Marin will spend $3.3 million to rehabilitate its Cove Road pump station, with work set to begin in spring 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district board of directors unanimously approved separate contracts at its April 17 meeting: $2.84 million with Fort Bragg-based Fort Bragg Electric for the construction and $168,889 with San Rafael-based Nute Engineering for construction management. Both contracts include a 10% contingency. Funding will come from the district’s capital reserves, District Manager Tony Rubio said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction is targeted for spring 2026 because it will take up to a year to obtain one of the necessary parts for the upgrade, the motor-control center, estimated to cost $628,000, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual work to rehabilitate the station, located at the corner of Cove and Barn roads in Belvedere, will last three to four months.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>School foundation saddling up for rodeo fundraiser</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/school-foundation-saddling-up-for-rodeo-fundraiser</link>
      <description>The May 10 event for the Reed Union district will feature dinner, dancing and a live auction.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Foundation for Reed Schools is asking parents to don their “boots and bling” for the May 10 , a Western-themed night of dinner and dancing to help raise money for enrichment classes at the Reed Union School District’s three schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event, set for 6 p.m. at Peacock Gap Golf Club in San Rafael, serves as the foundation’s final big push to meet its $2-million fundraising goal for the 2024-2025 school year, with most of that money going directly to the district to help support art, music, physical education, language and library programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen Feldman, the foundation’s director of marketing, communications and events, called the annual gala “a great way to bring the community together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a way for parents to come together and to help raise money and to really instill what the foundation does into the parents that attend,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Tiburon Councilmember Nikfar misses yet another state financial report deadline</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-councilmember-nikfar-misses-yet-another-state-financial-report-deadline</link>
      <description>The failure to file reflects a pattern for Nikfar, who missed three disclosure deadlines August 2023 and November 2024 elections.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Four Tiburon Town Council­members have disclosed economic interests totaling at least $2.84 million for 2024, while Councilmember Isaac Nikfar has once again failed to submit legally required financial reports by the state deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Councilmember Jack Ryan leads with a minimum of $1.17 million in economic interests, followed by Mayor Holli Thier with at least $1 million. Councilmember Alice Fredericks reported at least $453,013, while Vice Mayor Jon Welner disclosed at least $210,001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California law requires these annual economic-interest statements, known as Form 700, to be filed by April 1. The California Fair Political Practices Commission mandates that all elected officials and public employees “who (make) or (influence) governmental decisions” submit these disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure to file state-mandated financial disclosures for his office reflects a pattern for Nikfar, who missed two deadlines for campaign-finance disclosures related to the November 2024 election, most recently a semiannual report due Jan. 31. Nikfar also missed his initial campaign-fina...&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
