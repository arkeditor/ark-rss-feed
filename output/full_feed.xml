      <title>Belvedere council OKs new fees to generate $594K more each year</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-council-oks-new-fees-to-generate-594k-more-each-year</link>
      <description>The higher service charges aim to better cover expenses and close growing budget gaps.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere will increase its building and planning fees beginning July 1, a move aimed at allowing the city to recover more costs from development projects and free up general-fund money for citywide initiatives.</p>
<p>The City Council voted unanimously at its April 14 meeting to adopt the new fee structure, which is expected to generate an additional $594,000 annually for the city. The council had previously signaled its intent to approve the new fees at its March meeting.</p>
<p>The increases are based on a study from consultant ClearSource Financial that found Belvedere currently recovers only 53% of costs for services like home remodels and other development projects. The city collects about $1.07 million annually in fee revenues but spends about $2.04 million providing these services, requiring it to pull nearly $968,000 from the general fund to cover the gap.</p>
<p>The new fee structure would immediately increase cost recovery to 82% with a target of reaching 91% in future years through annual inflationary adjustments. Building services would reach 100% cost recovery in the...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Sticker shock pushes Bel Aire to rethink flood-control plans</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/sticker-shock-pushes-bel-aire-to-rethink-flood-control-plans</link>
      <description>The projected $1.1 million creek design is nearly three times what was anticipated.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Officials working on a flood-prevention project to restore two creeks in Tiburon’s Bel Aire neighborhood have ordered further studies after projected design and environmental-review costs for the work came back at $1.1 million — nearly three times what was anticipated.</p>
<p>The five-member Marin Flood Zone 4 advisory board voted 4-1 April 22, with member Carolyn Shadan dissenting, to direct West Sacramento-based firm CBEC, Inc. to spend $15,000-$20,000 to review information and literature surrounding hydrology and hydraulics at the East and West creeks in hopes of reducing the estimated design costs, which the board had budgeted at about $400,000 and which does not include the $2 million planned for constructing the project.</p>
<p>“It’s a very low-risk investment at this time that could get us closer to … the right direction in terms of overall project costs,” member Liza Gregory Bass said.</p>
<p>Judd Goodman, senior civil engineer with the water resources division at the Marin Public Works Department and the county’s staff liaison, said during the meeting that CBEC will be ab...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>The block party will run 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. May 16, with lower Main Street closed to car traffic.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ranch will celebrate 50 years as Tiburon and Belvedere’s joint recreation agency with two free 1970s-themed events next month: a May 7 trivia night and a May 16 block party on lower Main Street.</p>
<p>The themed trivia night is set for 6:30 p.m. at the Tiburon Tavern, 1651 Tiburon Blvd., with gift cards as prizes. The block party will run 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. downtown, with lower Main Street closed to car traffic from 4 to 9 p.m. to accommodate set up and take down.</p>
<p>The block party will feature dance covers from Shake It Booty Band, a photo booth, games and prizes. There will be a slot machine to win free Ranch merchandise and a booth where attendees can make pet rocks, which were a fad in the 1970s. There will also be birthday cake. Residents can check out The Ranch’s social-media accounts in the days leading up to the celebrations to see old photos from the agency’s early days.</p>
<p>Ranch Executive Director Jessica Hotchkiss said the agency wanted to pay homage to the decade it formed while also creating an event for residents to come together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Owner of The Cove apartments defaults on $210 mil loan as its financial troubles grow</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/owner-of-the-cove-apartments-defaults-on-210-mil-loan-as-its-financial-troubles-grow</link>
      <description>The Tiburon Peninsula property is not Maximus Real Estate Partners’ only troubled asset.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The owners of The Cove at Tiburon, a 283-unit luxury apartment complex on Barbaree Road just outside Tiburon town limits, have reportedly defaulted on a $210 million loan, which could force a sale or foreclosure.</p>
<p>According to multiple Bay Area publications, bond rater Morningstar announced April 1 that San Francisco-based Maximus Real Estate Partners, headed by investor and wine collector Robert “Big Boy” Rosania, defaulted after the loan reached maturity in March.</p>
<p>The Ark could not independently verify the default with Morningstar after a spokesperson declined to comment, but the San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco Business Times and real-estate news outlet The Real Deal all cited Morningstar in reporting on the default. The Business Times also cited notes sent to bondholders.</p>
<p>It remains unclear what future control of the property looks like. Maximus did not respond to multiple emails seeking comment over the past two weeks. Cove complex management also did not respond to messages left by phone or during an impromptu in-person visit to its leasing office l...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tiburon resident wins silver in world tennis tournament</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-resident-wins-silver-in-world-tennis-tournament</link>
      <description>The former college standout has returned to form in 40-plus doubles.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly five years after she decided to spend more time getting back into competitive tennis, Tiburon resident Angela Lawrence-Hendy is making her mark on the international stage.</p>
<p>The 48-year-old was the runner-up alongside teammate Mariko Fritz-Krockow, 42, of Corte Madera in the 40-and-up women’s doubles event at the International Tennis Federation’s World Individual Championships, held March 15-22 in Manavgat, Turkey. She also captained the Australian 45-and-up women’s team at the Margaret Court Cup as part of the World Team Championships March 9-14 in Manavgat.</p>
<p>Winning the silver medal was amazing, Lawrence-Hendy says, as five years ago, she talked to her husband, James Hendy, about competing in more tennis tournaments and what it would take to get to that level.</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘You know, I’m not really done competing,’” Lawrence-Hendy recalls. “I’d like to see if I can try and make top 50 in the world.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strawberry resident Suzanne Brooks says she’s enjoying a calm pace of life as she walks Bennie, her 2-year-old Australian labradoodle, along the San Francisco Bay Trail and Greenwood Cove Road April 22. She gives Bennie a treat as they walk, and he leaps to eat it.</p>
<p>Brooks, who currently works part-time managing properties in Marin and Sonoma counties and has recently taken up watercolor classes offered at the College of Marin, spent 33 years working in pharmaceutical sales, mostly in ophthalmology, before retiring in 2021.</p>
<p>“I was more satisfied than I ever thought I would be, honestly,” she says.</p>
<p>While she planned on being a bench researcher when entering college, that changed when Brooks waited tables while doing research.</p>
<p>“I liked waiting tables better than I liked doing the research,” Brooks says. “So that really told me how much of a people person that I am.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Owner: Cinelounge won’t close this week despite fundraising urgency</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/owner-cinelounge-won-t-close-this-week-despite-fundraising-urgency</link>
      <description>Email campaign was a ‘Hail Mary’ to generate support for the transition to a nonprofit.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon resident Christian Meoli says his downtown movie theater won’t close this week, despite a fundraising campaign that suggested Cinelounge needed to raise $500,000 by April 21 to survive.</p>
<p>Meoli, who co-owns the theater with his wife Camilla, acknowledged the messaging was a deliberate “Hail Mary” approach after earlier announcements about the theater’s planned transition to nonprofit status failed to gain traction.</p>
<p>“That’s the decision that I had to make to really jumpstart what we consider to be, so far, a very successful initiative,” Meoli said in an April 16 phone interview.</p>
<p>The theater’s GoFundMe campaign, titled “Preserve a Community Cinema Born from Love,” warned in an April 14 email that “our beloved Cinelounge could fade to black for good” without reaching its financial goal. But Meoli clarified that people could continue donating after the deadline, adding that meeting even part of the goal would provide a good start over the next couple of months toward resolving the theater’s financial struggles.</p>

      <title>Tiburon Councilmember Nikfar misses yet another state financial report deadline</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-councilmember-nikfar-misses-yet-another-state-financial-report-deadline</link>
      <description>The failure to file reflects a pattern for Nikfar, who missed three disclosure deadlines August 2023 and November 2024 elections.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four Tiburon Town Council­members have disclosed economic interests totaling at least $2.84 million for 2024, while Councilmember Isaac Nikfar has once again failed to submit legally required financial reports by the state deadline.</p>
<p>Councilmember Jack Ryan leads with a minimum of $1.17 million in economic interests, followed by Mayor Holli Thier with at least $1 million. Councilmember Alice Fredericks reported at least $453,013, while Vice Mayor Jon Welner disclosed at least $210,001.</p>
<p>California law requires these annual economic-interest statements, known as Form 700, to be filed by April 1. The California Fair Political Practices Commission mandates that all elected officials and public employees “who (make) or (influence) governmental decisions” submit these disclosures.</p>
<p>The failure to file state-mandated financial disclosures for his office reflects a pattern for Nikfar, who missed two deadlines for campaign-finance disclosures related to the November 2024 election, most recently a semiannual report due Jan. 31. Nikfar also missed his initial campaign-fina...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sanitary District No. 5 of Marin will spend $3.3 million to rehabilitate its Cove Road pump station, with work set to begin in spring 2026.</p>
<p>The district board of directors unanimously approved separate contracts at its April 17 meeting: $2.84 million with Fort Bragg-based Fort Bragg Electric for the construction and $168,889 with San Rafael-based Nute Engineering for construction management. Both contracts include a 10% contingency. Funding will come from the district’s capital reserves, District Manager Tony Rubio said.</p>
<p>Construction is targeted for spring 2026 because it will take up to a year to obtain one of the necessary parts for the upgrade, the motor-control center, estimated to cost $628,000, he said.</p>
<p>The actual work to rehabilitate the station, located at the corner of Cove and Barn roads in Belvedere, will last three to four months.</p>
<p>Nute Engineering, which also designed the project, found that the station’s electrical switchgear and motor-control center exhibited “age-related conditions, which include difficulty in finding replacement part...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Visitors to the Angel Island Immigration Museum can explore a new temporary exhibit examining border-surveillance technologythrough May 25, thanks to a collaboration with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>
<p>“Border Surveillance: Places, People and Technology,” which opened April 2 at the museum on Angel Island State Park in Tiburon, features panels detailing technologies used to monitor border crossings — from aerostats and drones to fixed cameras and ground sensors. The exhibit also explores emerging surveillance methods, including augmented reality and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Edward Tepporn, executive director of the Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation that oversees the museum, said that while the digital-privacy nonprofit developed the exhibit independently, he was proud the museum serves as its inaugural venue.</p>
<p>“Part of the interest in hosting it is that the work that we’ve done at the foundation, in collaboration with Angel Island State Park, over the past 40-plus years has been about lifting up the history of immigration through Angel Island, bu...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A longtime teacher and administrator in the Mill Valley School District has been named the next principal at Reed Elementary School.</p>

Board member Afsaneh Zolfaghari was absent.</p>

<p>Zhong, 65, has excelled at brush ink painting for more than 40 years. He grew up in northeast China, near the Russian border, during the Chinese Cultural Revolution and was always interested in art.

He then earned a master’s degree from Lu Xun Academy and became an editor for Art magazine, published by the China Artists Association.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Tiburon Mayor Holli Thier will join the crowded 2026 contest to replace Damon Connolly in the California State Assembly.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon Mayor Holli Thier will join the crowded 2026 contest to replace Damon Connolly in the California State Assembly.</p>
<p>Thier, who is in the first year of her third term on the Town Council, announced last week she intended to run for the District 12 seat, which covers all of Marin County and nearly half of Sonoma County, including Petaluma, Rohnert Park and Cotati.</p>
<p>Connolly, D-San Rafael, was elected in 2022 and has announced his campaign to replace President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, D-Healdsburg, in the state Senate, as McGuire terms out next year.</p>
<p>Thier confirmed her candidacy to The Ark in an April 11 email, citing issues such as the rising cost of living, insurance companies not writing policies for California homeowners and a need for “strong advocates … who can protect our residents against the dismantling of our democracy” with President Donald Trump in office for a second term.</p>
<p>Thier said she’ll stay on the Town Council “until the successful conclusion” of the Assembly race.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Cinelounge owner accuses film institute of unfair exclusivity deals</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/cinelounge-owner-accuses-film-institute-of-unfair-exclusivity-deals</link>
      <description>The theater owner's complaint says the operator of the Rafael, Sequoia and Mill Valley Film Fest is hurting his business.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cinelounge co-founder Christian Meoli is accusing the California Film Institute of “unfair and bullying tactics” for enforcing what he says are three-week exclusivity agreements with art house and specialty film distributors that prevent the downtown Tiburon theater from showing certain movies upon release.</p>
<p>Meoli on April 3 filed a claim with the Independent Theater Owners Coalition, an arm of the Cinema United trade organization, to end the exclusivity practices and is weighing his legal options, including potentially filing an antitrust claim.</p>
<p>The move came as Cinelounge’s nonprofit arm, theBelvedere Tiburon Film Society, abruptly launched a $500,000 fundraising campaign on April 14, saying in an email newsletter it needed to raise the cash by April 21 or the theater “could fade to black for good.”</p>]]></content:encoded>
