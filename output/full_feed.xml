     <title>Notes from an Appraiser: Selecting works for ‘Wabi-Sabi’ exhibit was fun break from routine</title>

     <description>Appraiser Cynthia Shaver juries O’Hanlon Center’s “Wabi-Sabi” exhibit in Mill Valley, celebrating beauty in imperfection with 60 selected works.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was the jurist for O’Hanlon Center for the Arts’ annual “Wabi-Sabi” exhibition. The name of the exhibit refers to the Japanese aesthetic philosophy that finds beauty in imperfection. It was this celebration of an “oops moment” that originally attracted me to Japan, a country I have visited dozens of times over 40 years.</p>
<p>In preparation to judge the Mill Valley exhibit, I watched a few videos on YouTube with the theme of wabi-sabi. The philosophy seemed so natural to me, the appreciation of the fine line of whimsy with serious art. As the jurist, I was tasked with selecting approximately 60 artworks from a submission of around 180 pieces. There were approximately 60 artists who submitted their art.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere weighs policy to reverse historic home designations</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-weighs-policy-to-reverse-historic-home-designations</link>
     <description>Belvedere may let historic-home owners remove designation after losing tax breaks, but council splits on whether exits should be easy or rigorous.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere will consider allowing owners of historic homes to request removal of the designation, though city councilmembers disagree on how easy it should be for residents to leave the program.</p>
<p>At its Aug. 11 meeting, the council directed member Kevin Burke to work with Planning and Building Director Rebecca Markwick on drafting a policy for reversing historic designation. The program is intended to recognize and protect historically, architecturally or culturally significant homes on the island but also restricts how such homes can be remodeled or modified.</p>
<p>As part of the discussion, Burke, Mayor Jane Cooper and Councilmember Pat Carapiet said the burden should be on the homeowner to prove why a home should no longer be considered historic. Councilmember Sally Wilkinson advocated for allowing homeowners who no longer want to be in the program an easy, ministerial exit, citing a desire not to burden staff with unnecessary work.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>The ‘Hansel and Gretel House’ at 246 Beach Road in Belvedere features storybook architecture designed by Jack Heidelberg in the mid-to-late 1930s. The City Council approved historic designation for the 1,935-square-foot cottage on Aug. 14, 2023, making it Belvedere’s 28th historic property. Owner Gal Bar-Or had intended to join the city’s Mills Act program for a property-tax reduction, but the council ended the program before the home could be considered, and now Bar-Or wants to rescind the historic status.

     <title>Belvedere seeking short-term police help from Marin County</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-seeking-short-term-police-help-from-marin-county</link>
     <description>Belvedere to hire a Marin sheriff’s deputy for up to six months to fill police staffing gaps as the city recruits a another full-time patrol officer.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere plans to contract with the Marin County Sheriff’s Office to help cover short-term police staffing gaps as it continues hiring efforts to permanently solidify the force.</p>
<p>In an Aug. 11 report to the City Council, City Manager Robert Zadnik said the city plans to borrow a deputy from the Sheriff’s Office to help cover shifts in Belvedere for three to six months. The move is meant to help ease chronic understaffing that has left four officers working 12-hour shifts and overtime to maintain round-the-clock coverage.</p>
<p>Zadnik said Aug. 11 that a draft agreement had been sent to the county, and in an Aug. 15 interview added that he hoped to have the contract finalized — and the deputy in service — within the next couple of weeks. The deputy, who would be outfitted in a Belvedere police uniform and drive a city police vehicle, will likely work night shifts, where the department’s needs are greatest, Zadnik said. Police Chief Jason Wu will have final say on the deputy selected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere&apos;s wildlife expert debunks coyote guide posted online</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-s-wildlife-expert-debunks-coyote-guide-posted-online</link>
     <description>Belvedere’s wildlife expert warns a viral coyote-control guide misstates laws, risks illegal traps and promotes ineffective lethal measures.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere’s wildlife consultant is warning residents that an online guide circulating about coyote-control laws contains dangerous misinformation that could lead to illegal and ineffective activities.</p>
<p>Rebecca Dmytryk of Moss Landing-based Humane Wildlife Control responded last week to a 15-page Google Doc posted Aug. 12 titled “A Definitive Guide to What the Law Actually Says About Coyote Control in Belvedere, CA.” The guide claims property owners can kill coyotes “at any time” and “in any manner” when protecting property.</p>
<p>The guide “contains multiple factual inaccuracies, misleading interpretations of the law and dangerous oversimplifications that could lead residents to engage in illegal, unsafe activities,” said Dmytryk, who was hired by the city in March 2023 to address rising coyote concerns.</p>
<p>The guide cites California Fish & Game codes that allow taking birds and mammals, but this applies only when they are “injuring growing crops or other property.” This requires active, ongoing damage, not just coyote presence or concern about potential threats, Dmytryk said.</p>
<p>The codes “are not blanket permissions for residents to kill wildlife at will,” she said. “‘At any time’ is not synonymous with ‘under any circumstances.’”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A self-taught sculptor builds a 40-year career in bronze</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-self-taught-sculptor-builds-a-40-year-career-in-bronze</link>
     <description>Self-taught Tiburon sculptor Kirk McGuire, 65, crafts world-renowned bronze marine-life art — from giant squids to mermaids — in his home studio.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Kirk McGuire told his bronze-foundry boss in 1984 that the company would someday be casting sculptures for him, the owner laughed and said he too had dreamed of being a sculptor but ended up working for artists instead.</p>
<p>Four decades later, the Old Tiburon resident’s bold prediction proved prophetic. McGuire’s bronze marine-life sculptures now grace collections from Monaco to Maui, Singapore to Seoul.</p>
<p>The sculptor, who turned 65 on July 24, has created more than 1,500 unique bronze statues from his home studio. His piece “Legend,” depicting a deep-sea giant squid, joined Triton Submarines on land tours after the company conducted sea explorations to spot the massive creatures. Meanwhile, the University of California at Berkeley has commissioned McGuire to create a sculpture of the endangered green pitcher plant,Sarracenia oreophila, honoring late environmental sciences professor Jan Washburn.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon adman John Crawford was behind SF Giants’ anti-mascot Crazy Crab</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-adman-john-crawford-was-behind-sf-giants-anti-mascot-crazy-crab</link>
     <description>John Crawford, the Tiburon advertising executive who created the San Francisco Giants’ notorious anti-mascot Crazy Crab, died May 27 at his home following complications from multiple health issues.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Crawford, the Tiburon advertising executive who created the San Francisco Giants’ notorious anti-mascot Crazy Crab, died May 27 at his home following complications from multiple health issues. He was 83.</p>
<p>Crawford’s nearly half-century career in advertising included developing campaigns for Round Table Pizza and the Yellow Pages, but he became best known for his work with the Giants in the 1980s, when he conceived both the deliberately obnoxious Crazy Crab and the beloved Croix de Candlestick commemorative pin.</p>
<p>His death was announced online Aug. 11.</p>
<p>The Crazy Crab phenomenon</p>
<p>Crazy Crab was introduced before the 1984 season to rile up fans, players and management during an era when teams were introducing family-friendly mascots. Giants fans loathed the trend — 63% of respondents in a 1983 poll said they would boo any mascot, The Athletic reported in 2020.</p>
<p>The team’s dismal 66-96 record, baseball’s worst that year, and Candlestick Park’s brutal conditions made fans even more hostile.</p>
<p>“When we sent him out past the bleachers at the Stick, it was like sending him into a bull ring,” Crawford told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2008 for a Crazy Crab retrospective ahead of a bobblehead giveaway. “We had to reinforce the suit with a fiberglass shell for protection.”</p>
<p>After facing attacks and body slams from Giants and visiting players, including current broadcaster and 1984 Giants pitcher Mike Krukow and future World Series-winning manager Bruce Bochy, as well as a barrage of batteries, golf balls and balloons filled with water and urine, Crazy Crab was eliminated after just one season.</p>
<p>The mascot has since attained cult status among fans and has been likened, including byMLB.com, as a prototype to Gritty, the Philadelphia Flyers’ mascot that has built a reputation as a raucous, edgy presence in the NHL and professional sports. Occasionally, Crazy Crab makes appearances, still to a chorus of boos, as he did during a July 27 ceremony honoring current, more beloved mascot Lou Seal’s 2024 induction into the Mascot Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Crawford also helped develop the Croix de Candlestick, the commemorative pin handed out to fans who endured Candlestick Park’s cold and winds during extra-inning night games. The pin featured the Latin phrase “veni, vidi, vixi,” or “I came, I saw, I lived.”</p>
<p>Crawford described fans who attended as either devoted or drunk as he recalled his first nighttime game at the p...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Ex-Richardson Bay sanitary chief Frank Dittle oversaw changes across 30 years</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/ex-richardson-bay-sanitary-chief-frank-dittle-oversaw-changes-across-30-years</link>
     <description>Frank Dittle, who served nearly 30 years at the Richardson Bay Sanitary District and rose to district manager, died of cancer Aug. 7 at his home in Woodacre.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frank Dittle, who served nearly 30 years at the Richardson Bay Sanitary District and rose to district manager, died of cancer Aug. 7 at his home in Woodacre. He was 79.</p>
<p>Dittle joined the sanitary district in 1976 as a wastewater operator trainee and retired Dec. 31, 2005. He oversaw operations beginning about 1990 at the district that spans from Strawberry into Tiburon, stopping at Gilmartin Drive.</p>
<p>He was at the district when it ceased to be a treatment facility in 1986 and entered an operating alliance with the Sewerage Agency of Southern Marin, the six-member wastewater-treatment agency that also includes Mill Valley and the unincorporated communities of Tamalpais Valley, Homestead Valley, Alto and Almonte.</p>
<p>Current district Manager Johnny Tucker, who was hired by Dittle in 1999 as a trainee operator and became manager in 2009, said learning from Dittle helped prepare him for eventually running the sanitary district. Tucker said Dittle would occasionally call to check in on how the district was doing or if Tucker had any questions.</p>
<p>Residents to this day ask Tucker if Dittle, known for his gravelly voice, still works at the district, nearly 20 years after his retirement.</p>
<p>“I like to tell people that I feel like he’s still working alongside me because I’ve run the place a lot like he did,” Tucker said.</p>
<p>Frank Thomas Dittle Jr. was born Dec. 18, 1945, in San Francisco to Frank Dittle Sr. and Frances Guth as the eldest of five sons, with brothers George, Pete, Steve and John. Dittle’s father, a clockmaker, was born in San Francisco and raised in Mill Valley, while his mother was born in Mountain View and raised in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Dittle Jr. grew up in Mill Valley, graduating from Tamalpais High School in 1963. From 1965 to 1967, he served in the U.S. Navy, enlisting during the Vietnam War, aboard the submarines USS Lapon and USS Kamehameha.</p>
<p>Following his Navy service, Dittle played a year of minor league baseball in the San Francisco Giants organization before returning to school. He earned bachelor’s degrees in physical education and business from San Francisco State University.</p>
<p>He married his wife, Jill, in 1996 in Lake Tahoe, and they had two sons together, Sean and Craig Tupper.</p>
<p>Craig Tupper said by email his dad loved to spend time with his four grandchildren and would never miss any of their sporting events, adding that his dad was often “the only voice you could hear at a baseball ga...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Salvatore ‘Sal’ Bonavita</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/salvatore-sal-bonavita</link>
     <description>Salvatore “Sal” Bonavita, 84, passed away Monday, July 28, from complications due to dementia.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Salvatore “Sal” Bonavita, 84, passed away Monday, July 28, from complications due to dementia. Sal was born in Brooklyn, NY, in 1941, and raised by his parents, Rita and Anthony Bonavita. As a child, he cherished listening to music with his grandfather while his grandmother baked. His love of opera and classical music, sparked in those early years, continued throughout his life.</p>
<p>He met his first wife, Odette (deceased), while picking up his college roommate — her older brother. By coincidence, both Sal and Odette later found their way to San Francisco, where they eventually married and raised their family in Tiburon-Belvedere.</p>
<p>From a young age, Sal’s entrepreneurial ambitions took him from the Catskill Mountains to Chicago, and ultimately to San Francisco. He became deeply engaged in the coffee, tea, and import business, founding Coffee Imports International. Through this venture, he was one of the first to bring espresso machines into the United States. In the late 1970s, Sal acquired Peet’s Coffee and Tea, having trained under Alfred Peet’s tutelage; the two remained lifelong friends. Over the years, Sal was involved in a variety of coffee and tea ventures, including Wolf in Santa Rosa and Bonavita in Mill Valley and San Rafael.</p>
<p>Sal was a man who truly loved life. A defining quote of his was “Love & Beauty,” a sentiment that perfectly captured his philosophy. Known for his generosity and equanimity, he was always willing to help a friend, mentor a colleague, and show deep love and devotion to his family.</p>
<p>In his later years, Sal shared his life with his second wife, Joan, who lovingly cared for him in their home until his passing. He is survived by Joan, his wife of 16 years; his two children, Anthony Bonavita and Nicole (Keith) Collins; his step-son, Brian Evjenth; and his four grandchildren, Sienna, Ronin, Anjali, and Declan.</p>
<p>In recognition of Sal’s passion for sailing and being on the water, a private ceremony to scatter his ashes at sea will be held in early September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Caltrans poised to delay Tiburon Boulevard bike lanes over bus safety</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/caltrans-poised-to-delay-tiburon-boulevard-bike-lanes-over-bus-safety</link>
     <description>Caltrans appears poised to delay controversial plans to install bike lanes along Tiburon Boulevard from Trestle Glen Boulevard to Blackfield Drive until fiscal 2027-2028.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what would be an abrupt about-face, Caltrans appears poised to delay controversial plans to install bike lanes along Tiburon Boulevard from Trestle Glen Boulevard to Blackfield Drive until fiscal 2027-2028, a win for local officials who assert the segment would disrupt school-bus service.</p>
<p>Bike advocates, however, said Caltrans is “poised to cave into a misinformation pressure campaign.”</p>
<p>According to a July 22 internal agency document obtained by The Ark, Caltrans cited “concerns about school bus safety” as its reason for removing the lanes from the first phase of its planned 4.6-mile preventive maintenance project spanning state-owned Highway 131 from outside Mill Valley to Tiburon Boulevard’s intersection with Main Street.</p>
<p>The document also indicates Caltrans plans to delay a Class-1 multiuse pathway along inbound Tiburon Boulevard between East Strawberry and Blackfield drives, in unincorporated Marin County, until the project’s second phase in fiscal 2027-2028. For now, it would be replaced with a Class-4 bikeway, in which cyclists are protected from traffic by a barrier. The document says Caltrans “will complete the remaining bikeways … after the scope is finalized with community and stakeholders.”</p>
<p>Project timeline and funding pressures</p>
<p>The agency had previously insisted the bike-lane project had to proceed during the first phase of the larger $12.7-million pavement job, planned for early 2026, citing funding deadlines and concerns that winter storms could further damage the deteriorating roadway.</p>
<p>Caltrans spokesperson Matt O’Donnell declined to comment on the internal document or the potential project changes between Trestle Glen and Blackfield, saying he could not speak about ongoing talks with the town of Tiburon and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>“We have been considering several options for the project that we hope will work best for the community” ahead of a late August deadline to have the plan finalized, O’Donnell said. He noted a draft version of the completed design had been sent to Tiburon and Marin County officials and was pending feedback.</p>
<p>He confirmed plans to swap the multiuse pathway with the protected bikeway in the first phase, saying that installing the path between East Strawberry and Blackfield drives would require reconstructing the landscaped median and relocating utilities and drainage inlets. Additional design work is also needed to rebuild a Marin Transit bus stop on inbound Ti...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>Caltrans’ July 22 ‘SR 131 Roadmap for Project Delivery Options’ document obtained by The Ark shows that, ‘due to concerns about school bus safety in the mixing zones at transit stops and objections to bike lanes in certain sections of the corridor,’ Caltrans will eliminate all planned Tiburon Boulevard bike lanes between Blackfield Drive and Trestle Glen Boulevard from Phase 1 of its road-rehabilitation project. Those will instead be built in Phase 2. Meanwhile, a Class-1 multiuse path between the 76 gas station and East Strawberry Boulevard will instead start as a Class-4 protected bikeway in Phase 1 and then be upgraded in Phase 2.</media:description>

     <title>Strawberry swimmer circles Lake Tahoe as training for 840-mile California coast swim</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-swimmer-circles-lake-tahoe-as-training-for-840-mile-california-coast-swim</link>
     <description>Covering 60 miles in six days, Catherine Breed is believed to be the first to follow the full Lake Tahoe Water Trail.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Catherine Breed graduated in 2015 from the University of California at Berkeley, where she cemented herself in the Golden Bears’ swim history books, she knew she wanted to continue in the sport, but she didn’t want to race.</p>
<p>Her love of ocean swims, which she’d complete as practice while at Cal, eventually led her to San Francisco’s Dolphin Club, known for its open-water swimming. Members there suggested to her that because “you’re pretty fast and you’re not intimidated by the cold and the current and the waves, you should try the English Channel.”</p>
<p>“That’s crazy,” the Strawberry resident recalls of her initial response. “Why would anyone swim 21 miles?”</p>
<p>Breed, 32, has since built a name for herself as an endurance and long-distance swimmer, taking on the English Channel, Monterey Bay, Catalina Channel and the Cook Strait, which separates New Zealand’s North and South islands.</p>
<p>More recently, she swam the roughly 60-mile circumference of Lake Tahoe, following the length of the Lake Tahoe Water Trail from July 16 to 21. While others have swam the lake’s circumference, Breed is believed to be the first swimmer to take on the trail over consecutive days as training for her planned endeavor to swim the roughly 840 miles of California’s coast, from its border with Oregon to the international border with Mexico.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon adds EV-readiness, stricter energy rules for more home projects</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-adds-ev-readiness-stricter-energy-rules-for-more-home-projects</link>
     <description>Tiburon will require EV-charging readiness and stricter energy-efficiency standards for more home projects starting in 2026.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon homeowners planning construction and renovations will face new requirements for electric-vehicle charging readiness and stricter energy-efficiency standards starting next year.</p>
<p>The new EV-readiness rule will apply to new construction and to upgrades involving main service panels at both single-family and multifamily residences. The energy-efficiency reach code, which “reaches” beyond state minimum requirements, will expand requirements to additions and alterations equaling or exceeding 500 square feet in single-family homes, down from the previous 750-square-foot threshold.</p>
<p>Those standards, called the “Flex Path,” require projects to meet a target energy score of six points, with certain actions worth specific points values: having air sealing and water-heating packages are each worth one point, while a high-efficiency heat-pump water heater is worth 13 points. Additionally, all exterior lights must have LED light bulbs and photocell controls. Accessory dwelling units and junior units, mobile homes or manufactured homes and owners enrolled in a cost-saving program are exempt from the requirements.</p>
<p>Enforcement of new provisions begins Jan. 1, 2026, after the Town Council at its Aug. 6 meeting unanimously approved the first reading to implement the changes. The council will conduct a second, required vote at its Aug. 20 meeting, and the ordinance will take effect 30 days later.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon council OKs $600k grant toward addressing sea rise</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/town-council-oks-600k-grant-toward-addressing-sea-rise</link>
     <description>Tiburon receives nearly $600K in state funds to create a sea-level rise vulnerability assessment and adaptation plan.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon has secured nearly $600,000 in state funding to help meet mandates requiring the town to address rising sea levels threatening its shorelines.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously Aug. 6 to accept a $593,877 grant from the California Ocean Protection Council. The funding will allow the town to hire a consultant to help create a sea-level rise vulnerability assessment and adaptation plan.</p>
<p>All coastal jurisdictions are required to adopt a Subregional Shoreline Adaptation Plan by 2034 under Senate Bill 272.</p>
<p>Grace Ledwith, the town’s climate action and sustainability coordinator, said the grant “is incredibly important” to help address sea-level rise.</p>
<p>“It allows us to dedicate resources to better understand the specific vulnerabilities facing Tiburon’s assets, ecosystems, local services or the people who live and work here,” she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>New leadership drives Tiburon Fire’s overhaul of strategic planning</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/new-leadership-drives-tiburon-fire-s-overhaul-of-strategic-planning</link>
     <description>Tiburon Fire will spend $49,875 on its first strategic plan in 15 years to guide operations and leadership changes.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tiburon Fire Protection District will spend $49,875 on its first strategic plan in 15 years as new leadership seeks to chart the agency’s direction amid a period of transition.</p>
<p>The board approved the contract with Fairfax-based consultant The People Piece in a 3-0 vote at its June 24 meeting, with members Joy Ho and Cheryl Woodford absent. Fire Chief Tommy Hellyer, who took over leadership in February after Chief Richard Pearce’s retirement, said the five-year plan should be completed by year’s end.</p>
<p>Hellyer selected The People Piece from three consulting firms after interviews and bid comparisons. Its Fairfax location offers “added accessibility and an understanding of our regional context,” he said, along with competitive pricing and organizational fit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-council-advances-updates-for-faster-lot-splits-duplex-approvals</link>
     <description>Tiburon updates housing rules to match new state law easing duplex, lot-split approvals in single-family neighborhoods.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will update local housing regulations to align them with recent changes to state law that streamline density increases in single-family neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously Aug. 6 to approve amendments to municipal code governing urban lot splits and two-unit housing developments. The ordinances will return for final adoption at the council’s Aug. 20 meeting and take effect 30 days later.</p>
<p>The changes will bring Tiburon into compliance with Senate Bill 450, which took effect Jan. 1 and modifies SB 9, California’s 2021 legislation allowing single-family homes to be converted into duplexes and residential parcels to be split into two lots without discretionary review.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon artist laureate aims to bridge community, environment</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-artist-laureate-aims-to-bridge-community-environment</link>
     <description>Christa Grenawalt begins a four-year term as the town&apos;s newest cultural ambassador.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artist Christa Grenawalt says she draws much of her inspiration from immersing herself in her surroundings.</p>
<p>Whether she’s plein air painting on the beaches of the Hawaiian isle of Kauai or more locally at Ring Mountain, Mount Tiburon or Old St. Hilary’s Open Space Preserve, she says she values “dropping in and paying attention to things that might normally be unnoticed in our environment and in nature.”</p>
<p>As an artist, she says, she not only wants to engage with her environment but with the larger community — and she’ll have the chance to do just that over the next four years as Tiburon’s artist laureate. She was appointed to the position by a unanimous vote of the council at its Aug. 6 meeting, replacing Richard Rozen, whose term ended in May 2022. Rozen crowned Grenawalt with a laurel wreath at the meeting to mark the handoff.</p>
<p>Grenawalt, 51, said she was looking into fostering creativity, nature and community, listing outdoor installations and participatory art as potential public projects to explore during her term, during which she noted she hopes to help locals “see themselves as part of a living artwork rooted in place and history and in a shared hope.”</p>
<p>“I believe that art can act as a bridge, and in this role, I’m hoping to use it to create connection between generations and across the communities here,” she told councilmembers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Powwow dances, storytelling, native foods set for Tiburon’s first Native American heritage celebration Aug. 17 at Zelinsky Park.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arts and crafts, storytelling and a live dance performance from an internationally touring group are planned for Tiburon’s inaugural celebration of Native American culture and heritage, set for 1-4 p.m. Aug. 17 at Zelinsky Park.</p>

The commission is co-organizing the free event, which also received financial support from Tiburon’s Diversity Inclusion Task Force.</p>
<p>A highlight of the afternoon will be “powwow-style dances” performed by Sewam American Indian Dance.

     <title>Tiburon officials back flood study for Greenwood Cove Drive</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-officials-back-flood-study-for-greenwood-cove-drive</link>
     <description>$200k proposal aims to ease chronic road problems tied to tides and runoff</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon officials have backed spending an initial $200,000 to find easy fixes for frequent flooding along a stretch of Greenwood Cove Drive that sometimes spills over onto Tiburon Boulevard.</p>
<p>The Marin Flood Control Zone 4 advisory board voted 3-0 at its July 22 meeting to direct county staff to send out requests for proposals to evaluate the area’s tidal flooding and stormwater drainage, particularly drainage from Upper Cecilia Way into East Creek. Member Liza Gregory Bass was absent, and the advisory board has one vacancy.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a very worthwhile investment,” said member Sheldon Dorph, who sits on a subcommittee that determined the scope of the study. He said the study would eventually help “so that I don’t need a boat to get out of my house, but I can still take the car.”</p>
<p>The Greenwood Cove Drive-Tiburon Boulevard corridor, which has segments in both incorporated and unincorporated Tiburon, has been known to flood following seasonal king tides. The flooding is magnified during substantial rainfall, sometimes causing the water to make its way to inbound Tiburon Boulevard, as it did last December, causing ankle-high flooding on Greenwood Cove and submerging an inbound lane on the boulevard next to the 76 gas station and the Marin Transit bus stop.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Mallard Pointe faces delays as city flags incomplete permits, tenant-benefit issues</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/mallard-pointe-faces-delays-as-city-flags-incomplete-permits-tenant-benefit-issues</link>
     <description>Revisions were expected as routine back-and-forth process enters next phase</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Mallard Pointe housing development faces construction delays until at least next spring after Belvedere officials found the developer failed to provide relocation benefits to displaced tenants and submitted incomplete permit applications missing dozens of required approvals.</p>
<p>The 40-unit lagoon-front project across from City Hall would demolish 22 existing rental units and build 40 new units at 1-22 Mallard Road. Belvedere on July 22 sent Thompson Dorfman LLC, a partner in owner Mallard Pointe 1951 LLC, incompleteness notices regarding the initial demolition and infrastructure plans submitted between October and April and bulkhead-replacement plans submitted in January and February, along with a compliance inquiry letter submitted June 18.</p>
<p>Principal Bruce Dorfman said he plans to submit revisions in the coming weeks and hopes to begin work next spring. He and Planning Director Rebecca Markwick both noted the process is routine, with Dorfman saying this kicks off what likely will be several iterations back and forth in a process that could last through the end of the year.</p>]]></content:encoded>
