     <title>New laws target gate hazards, throttle e-bikes for kids and distracted driving</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/new-laws-target-gate-hazards-throttle-e-bikes-for-kids-and-distracted-driving</link>
     <description>The local gate ordinance went into effect July 1 after being approved by the Town Council in May 2023.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new Tiburon rule now requires large gates to be outfitted with safeguards to prevent them from falling and potentially injuring or killing someone. The local ordinance joins a Marin-wide ban on throttle e-bikes for kids and a statewide ban on holding a phone while driving among new laws in place for the second half of 2025.</p>
<p>The local gate ordinance went into effect July 1 after being approved by the Town Council in May 2023. It requires property owners to ensure their vehicle and other automated and manual gates have posts that hold them upright if they become untethered from their tracks.</p>
<p>Any gate more than 48 inches wide or 84 inches tall must meet the standards and be designed, built and installed to:</p>
<p>Not fall over more than 45 degrees from a vertical plane when the gate is detached from supporting hardware.</p>
<p>Be balanced and not move under its own weight or by gravity.</p>
<p>Have covered rolling wheels, if applicable, to ensure they move smoothly.</p>
<p>Have positive stops to control the open and closed positions.</p>
<p>Gates must be inspected and certified at least once every five years.</p>
<p>The law was approved after urgings from former Greenbrae couple Eric and Dayna Quanbeck, whose 7-year-old son Alex was killed at Mark Day School in Terra Linda in December 2019 when a 450-pound metal rolling gate fell and hit him on the back of the head. Alex had tried to pull it shut during recess so the football that he and his classmates were tossing around would stay in the yard.</p>
<p>Tiburon Building Official Doug Haight said June 25 that the town has enforced the ordinance for all new gates, including requiring property owners undertaking remodels or having their home inspected to obtain a letter indicating their gate is certified.</p>
<p>“Part of what we’re going to be doing to try and gain compliance is try and educate people of their obligation under the ordinance,” he said.</p>
<p>Haight said there will be a reminder in an upcoming Tiburon Talk newsletter and that officials plan to send courtesy notices after they finish compiling a list of gates across town.</p>
<p>Enforcement will ultimately be determined in coordination with Town Manager Greg Chanis, who was on vacation and not available for comment by The Ark’s press deadline, Haight said, and whoever is hired as community development director to replace Dina Tasini, who left the role last month.</p>

     <title>Tiburon couple brings art, film to Marin County Fair</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-couple-brings-art-film-to-marin-county-fair</link>
     <description>In duo’s first exhibit together, recycled insect installation and a life-spanning short reflect decades of creative work.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A creative Tiburon couple — one a filmmaker and the other a sculptor — will each be featured at this year’sMarin County Fair, which runs July 2-6.</p>
<p>Cynthia Jensen, 77, widely known for her eco-inspired sculpture work, will display a series of insect sculptures made from recycled materials. Her husband, Harris Cohen, 88, whose decades-long film work includes editing Vietnam War footage for CBS and production for local station KPIX Channel 5, will show a short documentary at the fair. The exhibit coincides with this year’s fair theme, “Bug-Tastic.”</p>
<p>Cohen’s short film, “Passages: A Video Memoir,” shows at 6:15 p.m. July 3 at the Showcase Theater during the three-film Doc-Fest, part of the fair’s daily film festival. It traces his career as a videographer, producer and filmmaker. Originally created as a retrospective for his 87th birthday, Cohen said the film was intended for his grandchildren to understand more about his background.</p>
<p>Jensen’s artwork, which explores humankind’s impact on insect populations, will be displayed from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. July 2-6 in John MacLeod’s Virtual Reality booth in the fair’s exhibit hall. She said visitors can scan QR codes for information about various bugs. Her sculptures span more than 40 insects, including dragonflies, beetles, mosquitos and ladybugs. The display will also feature deep-sea exploration, including footage of the Cordell Bank off Point Reyes National Seashore, coral reefs and marine sanctuaries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon to hire designer for neighborhood park upgrades</title>

     <description>The work will focus on neighborhood miniparks at Cypress Hollow Park, Belveron Mini Park and the Bel Aire play area.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon plans to hire a landscape designer to explore updates for its neighborhood miniparks at Cypress Hollow Park, Belveron Mini Park and the Bel Aire play area, continuing the town’s directive to upgrade its parks.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously June 18 to approve a request for proposals to design the spaces. Community feedback for all parks indicated a need for greater maintenance and upkeep, with parks commissioners noting resident support for a new swing set for all children instead of the current toddler-only swings at Cypress Hollow Park, two to three benches at the Bel Aire space and removing flammable trees at Belveron Mini Park.</p>
<p>Public Works Engineering Manager David Eshoo said after the meeting that the timeline is in its early stages, but he hopes the Town Council can approve a design by September with Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission approval beforehand.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Arts commission explores proposal for positive-message street signs across town</title>

     <description>One red, octagonal sign says “start” instead of “stop.” Others feature a red circle with a solid bar saying “celebrate mistakes” instead of “do not enter.”</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon officials are considering a public-art project featuring imitation street signs with positive messaging.</p>
<p>The Heritage and Arts Commission voted 4-1 June 18 to gather more information about Los Angeles artist Scott Froschauer’s proposal for “The Word on the Street” before recommending funding. Commissioner Nora Noguez dissented, and Commissioners Liz Feibusch and Azita de Mujica were absent.</p>
<p>If backed by the arts commission, the project would need approval from the Parks, Open Space and Trails Commission and the Town Council.</p>
<p>The signs wouldn’t be placed in “spaces that are dangerous to automobile traffic,” such as roadsides or locations that could appear to lead toward roads from a distance, Froschauer wrote in his proposal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon teens Charlie Scott and Nick Hartung were each awarded a $2,500 National Merit Scholarship, recognizing their academic accomplishments and leadership abilities, as well as their potential to succeed in a rigorous college program.</p>
<p>Charlie and Nick, who graduated from Redwood High School earlier this month, were among just three students in Marin County and 2,500 nationwide to be awarded the prestigious 2025 scholarship through National Merit’s own funds. Their honors were announced in May.</p>
<p>Some 1.5 million high-school juniors nationwide took the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test in October 2023 as an initial screening for the National Merit Scholar program, with 16,000 students advancing as semifinalists after they became seniors. Semifinalists were then required to write an essay and detail activities, awards and leadership roles, had to be endorsed by a high-school official and then earn SAT and ACT scores that confirmed their test performance. Some 15,000 students met the academic standards to become finalists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Situated on the trail along Richardson Bay on June 18, Harry and his business partner, classmate Cole Peters, stand behind a white table blanketed with their merchandise: Hefty cups, clear pitchers of lemonade and a tray of cookies.</p>
<p>Harry says they’re popular due to the boys’ special recipe.</p>
<p>“It’s made from scratch. … Well, actually it’s from a package,” he says, though they add real lemons to make the juice “more lemony.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Bruce Charles Auld, 82, of Tiburon passed away peacefully at home on June 4, 2025.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bruce Charles Auld, 82, of Tiburon passed away peacefully at home on June 4, 2025. He is survived by his daughters, Ashley Auld-Fisher and Allie Auld-Hill; his grandchildren, Caroline Auld and William Auld-Hill; and his sister, Esther Ross. He is preceded in death by his beloved wife, Martha Auld, with whom he now rests in peace.</p>
<p>Born on February 13, 1943, in Seattle, Washington, Bruce lived a rich and full life defined by curiosity, craftsmanship, faith, and deep love for his family. Throughout his childhood, you would often find him sequestered in the basement of his family home building with erector sets, perfecting the knots he learned in Boy Scouts (and later Eagle Scouts), and teaching his niece and nephews (who lovingly called him “Uncle Chuck”) about math and science. Bruce also played football for the Queen Anne High School Grizzlies, and got into Columbia University on a track scholarship.</p>
<p>At Columbia, he earned his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, and his master’s in seismology. After school, he worked in geophysics and later started a small business providing field testing and analysis services. It was during this time that he met and fell in love with Martha. After a four-year courtship, they married on his birthday in 1977, and he built their forever home in the town of Tiburon, where they settled down to raise their family.</p>
<p>In his free time, he enjoyed tinkering with the latest (’80’s and ’90’s) computer technology, playing “King’s Quest” with his daughters, camping, fishing, playing the piano, and volunteering as a youth soccer coach. He was a gifted handyman that could fix nearly anything, insisting that no job was too big to tackle himself. He loved to garden, and enjoyed finding creative ways to transform his food surplus into meals and baked goods that he donated to the homeless. He has also served as a member of the vestry at St. Stephen’s Episcopal Church in Belvedere, where he dedicated his free time to keeping their services and computers running smoothly. He continued this work into his retirement, where he became an active Bridge player, opera goer, and crossword-puzzle addict. He also enjoyed relaxing with Martha on their back porch in Kauai, and fishing at Lake Powell.</p>
<p>His celebration of life memorial will be held at St. Stephen’s Episcopal Church in Belvedere/Tiburon on Aug 16, 2025, at 3:00 pm. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in support of the church he ...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-adopts-26-mil-budget-with-focus-on-parks-and-open-space</link>
     <description>At least $1.14 million is allocated for amenities and upgrades in fiscal 2025-2026.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon has adopted a $25.97-million budget that prioritizes its parks and open spaces, with at least $1.14 million allocated for amenities and upgrades in fiscal 2025-2026 and an additional $500,000 dedicated to its fund for future improvements.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously at its June 18 meeting to formally approve the budget, which showed no changes from the draft reviewed by the council earlier this month. The vote was part of the consent calendar, typically reserved for bulk approval of items deemed noncontroversial.</p>
<p>For fiscal 2025-2026, which begins July 1, the town is planning for $18.25 million in operating expenditures against $18.27 million in operating revenue, leaving a nearly $20,000 surplus. That doesn’t include the town’s $6.47 million capital-improvement program and $1.25 million in debt-services programs on equal revenue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon Town Council divided in bike-lane letter to Caltrans</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/council-divided-in-bike-lane-letter-to-caltrans</link>
     <description>Tiburon officials want to see safety revisions in the first phase, and Caltrans is mulling its options.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated:24 minutes ago</p>
<p>Tiburon officials have asked Caltrans to address the impacts of planned Tiburon Boulevard bike lanes on safety, public transit, school buses and traffic, with an agency representative confirming June 23 that it was “coordinating with the town of Tiburon and discussing several options internally.”</p>
<p>The Town Council had voted 3-2 to send the 143-word letter, with Mayor Holli Thier and Councilmember Jack Ryan dissenting, afternearly three hoursof public comment and discussion June 18. Ryan wants the entire bike-lane segment between Blackfield Drive and Trestle Glen removed, while Thier said without further elaboration that the letter didn’t address all her safety concerns.</p>
<p>At a special June 4 forum with councilmembers, Southern Marin Supervisor Stephanie Moulton-Peters and residents, Caltrans had said the$12.7-million preventive-maintenance projectmust proceed as planned because of funding deadlines and concerns that winter storms could further damage the deteriorating roadway. The agency announced the project would come intwo phases, with the original plan as phase one.</p>
<p>In its presentation, the agency initially signaled it was open to revisions — phase one included “work with community and stakeholders,” next steps were to “update plans for phase one” and said “we want to hear from you” — but it became clear as the meeting progressed that any major revisions were planned for phase two.</p>
<p>The project as it stands</p>
<p>The yearlong first phase, to start in 2026, would repave the 4.6 miles of state-owned Highway 131 from Mill Valley city limits to Tiburon Boulevard’s intersection with Main Street, upgrading drainage systems, guardrails, curb ramps, signs, traffic signals, lighting, crosswalks and intersections. Officials also said the plan would now incorporate afiber-optic broadband conduitat Tiburon’s request and preserve medians that would have been eliminated.</p>
<p>For the bike lanes, a multiuse path would connect East Strawberry Drive to Greenwood Cove Drive, which serves as the current bike route to the Old Rail Trail. Otherwise, there would be separated and protected Class-4 bikeways west of Blackie’s Pasture to the south and west of Reed Ranch Road to the north. A one-block segment of standard Class-2 bike lanes would stretch from Reed Ranch to Jefferson Drive, connecting to an existing protected path to Trestle Glen Boulevard.</p>

     <media:description>Caltrans plans to add protected Class-4 bikeways for most of the Tiburon Boulevard project in 2026, though protected lanes were assessed and deemed &quot;infeasible&quot; for a segment between Reed Ranch Road and Jefferson Drive over infrastructure concerns and are curently planned as standard, unprotected Class-2 bike lanes under Caltrans implementation guidelines. However, Caltrans now says new the Class-2 lanes will be upgraded to Class-4 in the second phase of the project in 2027-2028. The lanes will connect to the existing path in the curve to Trestle Glen, which already sits off the road behind a guardrail. The Safe Routes to Schools path will remain on Greenwood Beach Drive.

     <description>Tiburon’s Audrey MacLean, 19, is first female runner between 10 and 33 to win the nation’s oldest trail race.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Audrey MacLean had long been obsessed with the Dipsea Race, the nation’s oldest trail race, since she first learned about it as a seventh grader.</p>
<p>She first ran the race in the summer before eighth grade, though she notes at the time she “wasn’t that good at running.”</p>
<p>That’s since changed. The Tiburon resident, now 19, was crowned the winner of the 114th Dipsea Race on June 8 with a time of 46 minutes, 28 seconds — 20 seconds ahead of runner-up Mark Tatum and 1 minute, 41 seconds ahead of third-place finisher and defending champion Chris Lundy. MacLean, who graduated from Redwood High School in 2023 and attended Reed Union School District schools, made history as the first female runner between the ages of 10 and 33 to win the race.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>The sixth position has been deferred since 2020 due to budget constraints and one officer on medical leave.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere is considering hiring a sixth police officer or contracting with the Tiburon Police Department for overnight coverage to address a staffing shortage that has lingered since 2020.</p>
<p>The City Council discussed the options at its June 9 meeting, directing City Manager Robert Zadnik to research both and return with an update at the council’s July meeting.</p>
<p>With the department currently operating at four duty officers, the council and residents voiced strong opinions about officer fatigue, overnight police coverage and the ultimate costs to the city.</p>
<p>Belvedere considers six officers plus Police Chief Jason Wu to be fully staffed, but the sixth position has been deferred since 2020 due to budget constraints and one officer on medical leave.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Reed district projects $1.8-mil deficit on $33.2-mil budget</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-district-projects-1-8-mil-deficit-on-33-2-mil-budget</link>
     <description>Several factors are driving the projected deficit, including rising special-education costs, increased personnel costs and a funding gap for foundation-sponsored programs.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Reed Union School District is projecting a $1.83-million deficit in fiscal 2026 as it provides 5% raises to its teachers and staff and plans to spend an extra $1.18 million to close a funding gap for the arts, library and technology programs partially funded by the Foundation for Reed Schools.</p>
<p>The district’s board of trustees voted unanimously at its June 10 meeting to approve the $33.15-million budget against $31.51 million in revenue for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, which begins July 1.</p>
<p>While the district is projecting slight increases in its major sources of revenue, property and parcel taxes, it’s not expecting that to be enough to keep pace with its expenditures next year and will dip into its reserves to make up the difference.</p>
<p>Chief Business Official Chris Kim said several factors are driving the projected deficit, including rising special-education costs, increased personnel costs and the funding gap between the $1.75 million raised by the foundation and the estimated $2.93-million cost of its sponsored programs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>New Business: Istanbul natives bring Troya Mediterranean restaurant to Cove</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/new-business-istanbul-natives-bring-troya-mediterranean-restaurant-to-cove</link>
     <description>In May, the Kinalilars opened Troya restaurant in The Cove shopping center, serving Turkish and Mediterranean fare.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When husband-wife duo Berk and Betul Kinalilar would speak with Marin diners visiting their 19-year-old San Francisco restaurant,Troya, they’d often receive the same comment: “Open the restaurant in Marin.”</p>
<p>Living in the most diverse and dense culinary city in the nation, they said the request didn’t make much sense.</p>
<p>“We didn’t know anything about this area,” Betul says.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until they moved to Marin in 2018, and to Corte Madera on New Year’s Eve 2020, that they noticed that sit-down options for Turkish or Mediterranean were few.</p>
<p>“Now, it makes sense,” Betul says. “Tiburon and Marin needs more Mediterranean.”</p>
<p>So the Kinalilars acted on what their customers had been telling them all along. In May, they opened a second Troya restaurant serving Turkish and Mediterranean fare in The Cove shopping center, replacing fried-chicken sandwich shop Flybird. The restaurant served its first meal May 1 and expanded dinner service to Sundays through Thursdays on June 15.</p>]]></content:encoded>
