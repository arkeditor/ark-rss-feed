      <title>Owner: Cinelounge won’t close this week despite fundraising urgency</title>

      <description>Email campaign was a ‘Hail Mary’ to generate support for the transition to a nonprofit.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon resident Christian Meoli says his downtown movie theater won’t close this week, despite a fundraising campaign that suggested Cinelounge needed to raise $500,000 by April 21 to survive.</p>
<p>Meoli, who co-owns the theater with his wife Camilla, acknowledged the messaging was a deliberate “Hail Mary” approach after earlier announcements about the theater’s planned transition to nonprofit status failed to gain traction.</p>
<p>“That’s the decision that I had to make to really jumpstart what we consider to be, so far, a very successful initiative,” Meoli said in an April 16 phone interview.</p>
<p>The theater’s GoFundMe campaign, titled “Preserve a Community Cinema Born from Love,” warned in an April 14 email that “our beloved Cinelounge could fade to black for good” without reaching its financial goal. But Meoli clarified that people could continue donating after the deadline, adding that meeting even part of the goal would provide a good start over the next couple of months toward resolving the theater’s financial struggles.</p>

      <title>Tiburon Councilmember Nikfar misses yet another state financial report deadline</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-councilmember-nikfar-misses-yet-another-state-financial-report-deadline</link>
      <description>The failure to file reflects a pattern for Nikfar, who missed three disclosure deadlines August 2023 and November 2024 elections.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four Tiburon Town Council­members have disclosed economic interests totaling at least $2.84 million for 2024, while Councilmember Isaac Nikfar has once again failed to submit legally required financial reports by the state deadline.</p>
<p>Councilmember Jack Ryan leads with a minimum of $1.17 million in economic interests, followed by Mayor Holli Thier with at least $1 million. Councilmember Alice Fredericks reported at least $453,013, while Vice Mayor Jon Welner disclosed at least $210,001.</p>
<p>California law requires these annual economic-interest statements, known as Form 700, to be filed by April 1. The California Fair Political Practices Commission mandates that all elected officials and public employees “who (make) or (influence) governmental decisions” submit these disclosures.</p>
<p>The failure to file state-mandated financial disclosures for his office reflects a pattern for Nikfar, who missed two deadlines for campaign-finance disclosures related to the November 2024 election, most recently a semiannual report due Jan. 31. Nikfar also missed his initial campaign-fina...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>The May 10 event for the Reed Union district will feature dinner, dancing and a live auction.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Foundation for Reed Schools is asking parents to don their “boots and bling” for the May 10 , a Western-themed night of dinner and dancing to help raise money for enrichment classes at the Reed Union School District’s three schools.</p>
<p>The event, set for 6 p.m. at Peacock Gap Golf Club in San Rafael, serves as the foundation’s final big push to meet its $2-million fundraising goal for the 2024-2025 school year, with most of that money going directly to the district to help support art, music, physical education, language and library programs.</p>
<p>Jen Feldman, the foundation’s director of marketing, communications and events, called the annual gala “a great way to bring the community together.”</p>
<p>“This is a way for parents to come together and to help raise money and to really instill what the foundation does into the parents that attend,” she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Construction is targeted for spring 2026 because it will take up to a year to obtain one of the necessary parts for the upgrade.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sanitary District No. 5 of Marin will spend $3.3 million to rehabilitate its Cove Road pump station, with work set to begin in spring 2026.</p>
<p>The district board of directors unanimously approved separate contracts at its April 17 meeting: $2.84 million with Fort Bragg-based Fort Bragg Electric for the construction and $168,889 with San Rafael-based Nute Engineering for construction management. Both contracts include a 10% contingency. Funding will come from the district’s capital reserves, District Manager Tony Rubio said.</p>
<p>Construction is targeted for spring 2026 because it will take up to a year to obtain one of the necessary parts for the upgrade, the motor-control center, estimated to cost $628,000, he said.</p>
<p>The actual work to rehabilitate the station, located at the corner of Cove and Barn roads in Belvedere, will last three to four months.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Aubrey O’Connor is the new Reed Elementary School principal, replacing Mary Niesyn, who is retiring.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A longtime teacher and administrator in the Mill Valley School District has been named the next principal at Reed Elementary School.</p>
<p>Aubrey O’Connor, the current principal at Park Elementary School, will join the Reed Union School District July 1, with a starting annual salary of $200,000. Her hiring was approved by a 4-0 vote of the district board at its April 15 meeting; the item was included in the district’s personnel report as part of the board’s consent agenda, reserved for bulk approval of items deemed noncontroversial. Board member Afsaneh Zolfaghari was absent.</p>
<p>O’Connor was chosen among seven applicants interviewed to replace Mary Niesyn, who is retiring after a 21-year career at the school that saw her serve as a second-grade teacher and assistant principal before assuming the top job in 2015.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tiburon poet finds healing through verse</title>
      <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-poet-finds-healing-through-verse</link>
      <description>Ashley Moyo uses the spoken word to process grief, identity and life as part of African diaspora.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ashley Moyo wrote her first poem at age 9 for a school assignment about glasses. She continued using poetry throughout her education, including as a Model United Nations member in high school, when she began her speeches with poems rather than quotes or statistics.</p>
<p>“I saw that (poems) had a huge impact, like I could hold the crowd in that in those moments,” Moyo says.</p>
<p>The Tiburon resident says she began taking poetry seriously in 2018 during her senior year of high school after sharing one of her poems at an interactive theater show. The director reached out afterward and asked if she wanted to try slam poetry, a type of competition where poets perform original work before a live audience and judges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The students raise their hands eagerly when they have questions and ideas, with some running up to the board to tell their instructor, Terra Linda resident Leo Maso, what they would do in each scenario.</p>
<p>Wong, the 19-year-old executive director of , says he enjoys seeing the students’ enthusiasm to learn the game, which he says teaches kids larger problem-solving skills, as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>
