     <title>Tiburon bike lanes pushed to 2029 as Caltrans proceeds along rest of corridor</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-bike-lanes-pushed-to-2029-as-caltrans-proceeds-along-rest-of-corridor</link>
     <description>The Phase 1 start date hinges on Tiburon first completing a separate project to install underground conduit for fiber-optic cables along the boulevard.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caltrans has confirmed it will pursue Tiburon Boulevard bike lanes within town limits in a second phase of improvements — with funding to be secured next year and construction targeted for early 2029 — as the final design is now complete for its 4.6-mile Mill Valley-to-Tiburon pavement project set to start next summer.</p>
<p>The Phase 1 start date hinges on Tiburon first completing a separate project to install underground conduit for fiber-optic cables along the boulevard, agency spokesperson Matt O’Donnell said. The town took on the work after Caltrans considered adding it to the maintenance project but ultimately deferred.</p>
<p>The Caltrans improvements along state-owned Highway 131, which doubles as East Blithedale Avenue in Mill Valley and as Tiburon Boulevard east of the southbound Highway 101 on-ramp, are expected to take a year, wrapping in summer 2027. They include repaving, drainage upgrades, guardrails, curb ramps, signs, traffic signals, lighting, crosswalks and intersection improvements. The California Transportation Commission in October allocated $18.57 million toward the work, though Matt O’Donnell said construction costs would be closer to $15.2 million.</p>
<p>Phase 2 would include a stakeholder task force “to provide inclusive community input and develop an endorsed scope and configuration for bikeway and transit improvements,” O’Donnell said.</p>
<p>Caltrans, the county and Southern Marin Supervisor Stephanie Moulton-Peters are coordinating to select a task-force facilitator, O’Donnell said, as the agency looks to “finalize task-force membership and convene the group in early 2026.”</p>
<p>New lanes coming to Mill Valley, unincorporated areas</p>
<p>Caltrans will, however, proceed with creating new Class 2 bike lanes on both sides of the road in Mill Valley, Strawberry and unincorporated Tiburon, starting from Mill Valley’s Tower Road-East Blithedale intersection. The lanes will run along the Highway 101 overpass, becoming Class 4 protected bikeways on Tiburon Boulevard at South Knoll Road and North Knoll Road before ending at Blackfield Drive.</p>
<p>On the south side, a temporary Class 1 multiuse path — with a permanent path to follow in Phase 2 — will be created between Strawberry and Blackfield drives. That path leads to the existing Class 3 bike route along Greenwood Cove Drive and Greenwood Beach Road, where residents have long complained about bike traffic and have sought to redirect faster cyclists out to Tiburon Boulevard...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon muralist turns Corte Madera underpass into art</title>

     <description>“The Sky Whales” features three whales painted in light blues and pinks swimming, or flying, through a pink sky with a full moon alongside pelicans and egrets.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Rachel Hébert, raising kids in Marin meant being a frequent shopper at the Trader Joe’s in Greenbrae. Getting there meant driving through the Wornum Drive underpass at Highway 101. Each trip, she’d eye the massive gray wall.</p>
<p>“I just had this idea that that big, blank gray wall should be something else,” she said.</p>
<p>So the Tiburon resident, a professional muralist and artist, took matters into her own hands and last month completed a 100-foot-long, 11-foot-tall mural spanning the southern length of the underpass.</p>
<p>“The Sky Whales” features three whales painted in light blues and pinks swimming, or flying, through a pink sky with a full moon alongside pelicans and egrets.</p>
<p>The mural took about a month to paint, but it followed a three-year process that involved getting approvals from Caltrans, which owns the wall that is also load-bearing for the highway that travels over it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Tiburon residents looking to build tiny homes will soon face fewer regulatory hurdles under building-code updates approved Nov. 19.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon residents looking to build tiny homes will soon face fewer regulatory hurdles under building-code updates the Town Council approved Nov. 19.</p>
<p>The council voted 4-0, with Councilmember Isaac Nikfar absent, to adopt changes from the 2025 state building code. The updates also reaffirm earlier-approved rules for electric-vehicle charging readiness and stricter energy-efficiency standards. A second vote takes place Dec. 3, and the changes take effect 30 days later.</p>
<p>The most substantial update is “more flexible regulations for what are considered tiny homes,” interim Community Development Director Neal Toft said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: A musician leaves tech to help others build connections</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-a-musician-leaves-tech-to-help-others-build-connections</link>
     <description>Kedar Shashidhar worked in social media, virtual reality and artificial intelligence but recently left tech to become a life coach.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The melodic sounds of the Hanuman Chalisa, a Hindu devotional hymn, fills The Boardwalk shopping center Nov. 18. The chant, singer Kedar Shashidhar says, praises Hanuman, the Hindu deity depicted as a monkey, and his “strength, vitality and courage.”</p>
<p>“I’m in a moment in the chapter where I’m like, ‘OK, yeah, I’m calling in that kind of strength, a brightness, as I meet the world,” Shashidhar says.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old Tiburon resident previously worked in social media, virtual reality and artificial intelligence but recently left tech to become a life coach as The Relational Accelerator. His goal, he says, is to “help people build meaningful relationships both professionally and in their deeper world.”</p>
<p>He made the career switch after realizing the technology he was developing “was actually pulling people apart rather than bringing people together, despite it saying that it was bringing people together.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere OKs housing plan, zoning overhaul for state approval</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-oks-housing-plan-zoning-overhaul-for-state-approval</link>
     <description>The votes effectively end nearly four years of work to bring the city into compliance with state housing requirements.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Belvedere City Council unanimously approved a package of housing reforms Nov. 10, effectively ending nearly four years of work to bring the city into compliance with state requirements to accommodate at least 160 new housing units.</p>
<p>Officials voted to formally adopt the state-mandated 2023-2031 housing element and, in a separate vote, approved a set of zoning amendments that will allow for new development under the eight-year roadmap.</p>
<p>The California Department of Housing and Community Development indicated in July that revisions in the fourth draft of the element — which was required to be in place by Jan. 31, 2023 — would comply with state law but, because the city missed several implementation deadlines, the element could not be certified until the zoning amendments are in place.</p>
<p>The City Council is expected to formally adopt those amendments in a required second vote Dec. 8, after which Belvedere will submit both documents to Sacramento for review and certification.</p>
<p>The changes address affordable-housing requirements and incentives, streamlined approvals for developments with at least 20% affordable units, updated design and development standards, mixed-use housing, emergency shelters, parking and reasonable-accommodation requests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere shifting coyote reporting to Marin Humane</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-shifting-coyote-reporting-to-marin-humane</link>
     <description>Since 2023, at least five dogs and four cats have been killed by coyotes, and seven other pets have been injured, according to reports received by the city.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere residents will soon report coyote sightings to Marin Humane rather than the city under a new agreement that will maintain most of the response services residents have received for the past two years.</p>
<p>The city already pays the nonprofit $25,000 annually, its share of an agreement with Marin County to provide animal-control services to cities and towns countywide. It will now pay an additional $7,800 per year for a separate coyote-focused contract that will handle all coyote-related incidents, including receiving reports about local coyote sightings and interactions. The arrangement represents a slight savings over the $8,000 the city has been paying consultant Rebecca Dmytryk annually since 2023.</p>
<p>The agreement, set to be finalized by the end of the month, signals a shift in strategy for Belvedere, which contracted with Dmytryk of Humane Wildlife Control to create a comprehensive coyote-management plan and evaluate coyote-denning behavior. During that time, the city received and tracked reports directly through a dedicated hotline and web submission form, and officials worked with Dmytryk to respond to incidents when necessary.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere homeowners face $2,928 fee to exit historic designation</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-homeowners-face-2-928-fee-to-exit-historic-designation</link>
     <description>Belvedere residents who missed out on the Mills Act tax-incentive program can get $366 streamlined removal.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belvedere homeowners who want out of the city’s historic designation program must pay $2,928 and navigate a multistep approval process under fees the City Council unanimously approved Nov. 10.</p>
<p>The council offered a break to five homeowners caught in limbo when the city ended its Mills Act program. Those who won historic designation between June 1, 2021, and May 1, 2024, but never received the program’s property-tax breaks, can apply for streamlined removal by Feb. 13 and pay just $366.</p>
<p>Both fees took effect immediately.</p>
<p>The vote put the finishing touches on an ordinance the council adopted in October that creates the first formal pathway for property owners to exit the program. Some 30 homes in Belvedere hold historic designation.</p>
<p>To be removed, homeowners must pay the fee, submit an application explaining why decertification is warranted, win approval from the Historic Preservation Committee and earn final sign-off from the City Council.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Mill Valley’s Alexandra Duparc filmed Christian and Camilla Meoli for the “Saving Cinema” pilot in October.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A director who co-wrote a $34 million Netflix legal drama has turned her camera on downtown Tiburon’s Cinelounge, filming a reality TV pilot about the theater’s husband-and-wife owners and their mission to save the moviegoing experience.</p>
<p>Mill Valley’s Alexandra Duparc filmed Christian and Camilla Meoli for the “Saving Cinema” pilot Oct. 26-27. She is still shopping the show, which blends reality footage with scripted elements, to streaming services.</p>
<p>Duparc previously co-wrote “Monsanto,” a yet-to-be filmed legal drama with “The Blind Side” director John Lee Hancock, who is directing “Monsanto.” The film is set to star Glen Powell, Anthony Mackie and Laura Dern.</p>
<p>Friends and associates encouraged Duparc to meet the Meolis. The instant connection led her to assist with Cinelounge’s fundraising efforts as the theater works to transition to a nonprofit. She also began managing its social media.</p>
<p>“Then in doing that, I think I just felt deeply more in love with all of it and went like, ‘You know, I think that the world needs to know that these kinds of things are happening because for something that’s such a dying business, there’s not very many people holding the net to save anyone,’” Duparc says. “And it’s kind of freaking me out.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon council will review traffic study in January following delays</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-council-will-review-traffic-study-in-january-following-delays</link>
     <description>The consultant attributed the delays to Caltrans taking additional time to finalize its 4.6-mile preventive-maintenance project of Tiburon Boulevard.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Initial findings from Tiburon’s traffic study are now expected to be presented to the Town Council in January, some seven months later than the original target date. The consultant in charge of the project has attributed the delays to Caltrans taking additional time to finalize its 4.6-mile preventive-maintenance project of Tiburon Boulevard set to begin next summer.</p>
<p>Representatives from Parametrix, the firm hired by the town to complete the traffic study, previously said they hoped to have results to present to the town in June. However, the firm had to slow down its work as Caltrans, which is responsible for maintaining Tiburon Boulevard as State Route 131, weighed the details of its preventative-maintenance projects, including whether to include controversial bike lanes along Tiburon Boulevard from Trestle Glen Boulevard to Blackfield Drive and if it could incorporate Tiburon’s plans to install conduit that could carry fiber-optic cables, Public Works engineering manager David Eshoo said Nov. 14.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere-Tiburon Library exhibit pairs Bay Area creators with muses from art history</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-tiburon-library-exhibit-pairs-bay-area-creators-with-muses-from-art-history</link>
     <description>Rachel Davis, Nadine Levin and Joyce Bell are among 58 Bay Area artists featured in “Pairings &amp; Echoes,” which runs Nov. 20 through Jan. 7.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Rachel Davis stared at the figure in her painting “Surrender, After Suzanne and Esther,” she knew something was wrong. She tried 10 different faces over as many months. Her fellow artists at ICB Art in Sausalito rallied around her, posing and offering advice. The running joke became: “Whose head is on the body today?”</p>
<p>The answer, finally, was none at all.</p>
<p>Davis, Nadine Levin and Joyce Bell are among 58 Bay Area artists featured in “Pairings & Echoes,” an exhibit at the Belvedere-Tiburon Library that explores artistic conversations across time and medium. The show runs Nov. 20 through Jan. 7, with an artists’ reception from 6 to 8 p.m. Nov. 20.</p>
<p>Each artist submitted work inspired by another artist’s creation. Posted alongside each piece will be a small image of the work that sparked the new art.</p>
<p>Exhibit co-chair Katie Sutton said she’s particularly excited for this show, noting that it’s “something a little different” to see how artists take inspiration from an existing work and make it their own.</p>
<p>“Some lean into a more literal visual approach, while others focus more on the emotional side of their reference,” Sutton said. “It’s so interesting to watch their creativity come to life and see into the mind of each artist.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>EV Maritime is designing the 64-foot plug-in-hybrid vessel tentatively named Watts Up.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New Zealand firm building the Angel Island-Tiburon Ferry Co.’s new plug-in-hybrid vessel has unveiled the design, marking a major milestone in the first-in-California effort to electrify the fleet.</p>
<p>EV Maritime is designing the 64-foot plug-in-hybrid vessel tentatively named Watts Up. The company revealed the design exclusively to The Ark following a Nov. 10 interview with CEO and co-founder Michael Eaglen and ferry company owner Capt. Maggie McDonogh.</p>
<p>Eaglen said having a rendering ready shows the project is advancing. The team is “more firmly committing when you’re telling other people what it’s going to look like.”</p>
<p>The ferry company and EV Maritime partnered in July 2024 to build the roughly $12 million vessel as part of a $24 million grant from the California Air Resources Board awarded through the town of Tiburon. Matching grants bring total funding to $31 million.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>Eugene (‘Gene’) Allan McCabe: May 18, 1933–November 3, 2025</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May 18, 1933– November 3, 2025</p>
<p>His educational, military, social, outdoor, and professional accomplishments reflected the intelligence and hard work of an honorable self-made man who rose from humble beginnings. Yet Gene’s purposeful life was defined by far more than his degrees, titles, or accolades.</p>
<p>Guided by unwavering integrity — and strengthened by the discipline and courage to always do what was right — he found deep and lasting happiness. His life was enriched by genuine friendships, by days filled with affection, service, and by a respect for those around him.</p>
<p>Gene met his first wife, Debby McCabe, beneath Sather Gate, where their story began. They shared 53 years of marriage until her passing in 2010. Soon after, Joy Kuhn McCabe entered his life. Warmly welcomed by her family, at age 78 Gene began a new chapter, settling into a new Marin life with Joy. Together, he and Joy traveled, entertained friends and family, and found great pleasure in simply being together.</p>
<p>Gene also treasured the company of friends from all walks of life — from his college fraternity and ski patrol days to those he met through the many clubs and organizations he joined or supported across the East Bay, San Francisco, and Marin County. Among these friends were those in and around the Bohemian Club’s electricity-free Iron Ring camp, where he found camaraderie — and first met Joy during a picnic.</p>
<p>He is survived by his devoted wife, Joy Kuhn McCabe of Tiburon; his brother, Jack; his daughter, Martha; his son, Charlie; stepchildren Steve (Teri) Kuhn, Gary (Heidi) Kühn, and Leslie (Frank) Doyle; grandchildren and step-great-grandchildren; and many cousins, nieces, and nephews.</p>
<p>He passed away at age 92, as he had lived — happily, surrounded by family, on his own terms, with independence, dignity, and grace.</p>
<p>A private family memorial service will be held. His love, kindness, honesty, and understanding remain an enduring inspiration to all who knew him. And when a man of integrity and accomplishment is fortunate enough to experience two great loves in a single lifetime — first with Debby, and then with Joy — what greater gifts could life offer?</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Lorrie Lee Levin Greene</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/lorrie-lee-levin-greene</link>
     <description>Lorrie Lee Levin Greene, a lifelong Bay Area native, passed away surrounded by family peacefully at home on November 7, 2025, at the age of 83.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>March 4, 1942– November 7, 2025</p>
<p>Lorrie Lee Levin Greene, a lifelong Bay Area native, passed away surrounded by family peacefully at home on November 7, 2025, at the age of 83.</p>
<p>Born and raised in San Francisco, Lorrie attended Lowell High School before graduating from the University of California, Berkeley in 1962 where she was a proud member of Alpha Epsilon Phi. It was there, in the spring of 1960, that she met her husband of 62 years, Richard Lawrence Greene — he was a senior while she was a freshman. Their story began when he playfully pushed her in a fraternity pushcart race, sparking a romance that led to their marriage on January 27, 1963, and more than six decades of love, laughter, travel and partnership.</p>
<p>After settling in Tiburon, California, Lorrie and Richard built a warm and welcoming home filled with family, friendship, and art. For decades, Lorrie hosted many fabulous parties at their Tiburon home bringing together lifelong friends and the community. Together, they shared an extraordinary sense of adventure, traveling to more than 70 countries around the world and embracing every new culture and experience with curiosity and joy.</p>
<p>Lorrie was a devoted wife to Richard Lawrence Greene, loving mother to Dana Michele Greene (Bryan Rickert), Julie Allyson Greene McEver (AJ McEver), and Elisa Suzanne Greene Briles (Tyler Briles), beloved sister to Michael Levin and a proud grandmother to Ella Rylee McEver and Kaylen Tyler McEver, who brought her endless joy.</p>
<p>Lorrie held a multitude of positions throughout her life — working as a teacher, interior designer, and office move consultant. She also lent her artistic eye to Richard’s professional spaces, designing all three of his offices — from the furniture to the art work, ensuring that the firm had a first-class look.</p>
<p>A passionate advocate for art, education, and community, Lorrie founded NCC-NMWA (the Northern California Committee of the National Museum of Women in the Arts) and StreetSmart4Kids – Dine Out and Donate, an organization that brought restaurants and local communities together to support Bay Area children in need. She served on the Reed School District PTA, was a Marin Day School (now Bright Horizons Daycare) board member, and led the KQED auction for several years.</p>
<p>Lorrie was a patron of the arts, a champion of women, and a trusted friend to everyone she met. Her incredible vibrancy, sense of style, warmth and generosity to everyone leav...</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>William Blackmer Canada</title>

     <description>William Blackmer Canada, born on November 8, 1939, at St. John’s Hospital in Tulsa, OK, passed away on November 3rd.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>William Blackmer Canada, born on November 8, 1939, at St. John’s Hospital in Tulsa, OK, passed away on November 3rd after a courageous battle with prostate cancer. Bill was the beloved son of Edith and Alonzo F. Canada. His early years were spent in Tulsa, attending Barnard Elementary and Wilson Middle schools before his family relocated to Downey, California. There, he graduated from Downey High School in 1957. Bill returned to Oklahoma to study at Oklahoma State University, where he earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Industrial Engineering.</p>
<p>In 1962, Bill was commissioned as an officer in the Army, beginning active duty at Ft. Bragg, NC. He completed a basic officer’s course and attended flight school at Ft. Rucker, AL, graduating in 1963. Shortly after, he embarked on a distinguished career with American Airlines, where he served as a dedicated pilot and retired as captain in September 1999.</p>
<p>An enthusiastic sailor and avid skier, Bill’s love for adventure led him to the Corinthian Yacht Club, where he met his wife, Chris, in 1977. The couple married in 1978 aboard their Islander 36, sailing down Raccoon Straits under full spinnaker. Bill’s passion for sailing was evident in his commitment to the Corinthian Yacht Club, which he joined in December 1974. He served as Commodore in 1991 and 1992, leaving a lasting impact on the community.</p>
<p>In 2000, Bill joined the St. Francis Yacht Club, quickly becoming an active and valued member. He was dedicated to volunteering for the race committee, bringing his expertise and enthusiasm to the Big Boat Series and many other regattas. Bill was renowned for his meticulous attention to detail and his talent for fostering camaraderie among sailors and volunteers.</p>
<p>After many years of competitive sailboat racing, Bill embraced a new chapter by purchasing a motor yacht he named “Jazz,” reflecting his lifelong love of music and the arts. Summers spent aboard Jazz at Tinsley Island became a cherished tradition for Bill and his family, filled with warm Delta breezes, gatherings with friends, and unforgettable nights under the stars.</p>
<p>Music was always close to Bill’s heart. He studied drumming at Drum City in Hollywood during his youth and later took lessons with Jason Gianni. He formed a rock band with local friends and was the first band to play a concert at Pac Bell Park in 2000. He eventually founded the jazz quartet The Bill Canada Jazz Experience.</p>

     <title>Tiburon hires consultant to prepare for rising sea levels</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-hires-consultant-to-prepare-for-rising-sea-levels</link>
     <description>Tiburon will spend nearly $600,000 in state grant money to hire a consultant to plan how the town will address rising sea levels threatening its shorelines.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will spend nearly $600,000 in state grant money to hire a consultant to plan how the town will address rising sea levels threatening its shorelines.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted 3-0 Nov. 5 to approve a contract with multinational firm Moffatt and Nichol for the work, which will cost $593,877 using funds awarded in June by the California Ocean Protection Council.</p>
<p>All coastal jurisdictions are required to create a sea-level-rise vulnerability assessment and adaptation plan, known formally as a Subregional Shoreline Adaptation Plan, by 2034 under Senate Bill 272.</p>
<p>Grace Ledwith, Tiburon’s climate action and sustainability coordinator, said while the county has done various vulnerability assessments and sea-level rise studies, none covered town-specific vulnerabilities and assets.</p>
<p>“This will be a first-time effort really diving into our specific concerns,” Ledwith told councilmembers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon officer charged with DUI, child cruelty, pleads not guilty</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-officer-charged-with-dui-child-cruelty-pleads-not-guilty</link>
     <description>Tiburon police officer William Forrest Condit has pleaded not guilty to one count of misdemeanor child cruelty and two counts of misdemeanor drunken driving.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon police officer William Forrest Condit has pleaded not guilty to one count of misdemeanor child cruelty and two counts of misdemeanor drunken driving following his Oct. 13 arrest near downtown Petaluma. Both DUI counts carry sentencing-enhancement requests for endangerment of a child passenger.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old Sebastopol resident entered the plea in Sonoma County Superior Court Nov. 10. The county District Attorney’s Office formally filed the charges Nov. 5.</p>
<p>Condit has been with the Tiburon Police Department since 2019 and was placed on administrative leave following his arrest, Chief Michelle Jean said last month. He was off duty when Petaluma police conducted a traffic stop after observing indications of impaired driving, authorities said.</p>
<p>Petaluma police and the District Attorney’s Office both declined to comment on further details, including Condit’s relationship to the child, his blood-alcohol level or how it was measured.</p>
<p>The DUI charges are for driving under the influence of alcohol and for driving with a blood-alcohol content exceeding 0.08%, California’s legal maximum for those 21 and older.</p>
<p>If convicted, Condit could face up to six months in jail, more than $10,000 in fines after penalty assessments, suspension of his driver’s license and probation. The child-endangerment enhancements each carry an additional mandatory 48 hours in jail.</p>
<p>Under state law, a defendant can be charged with but not convicted of both the endangerment enhancements and the child-cruelty charge for the same incident.</p>
<p>If convicted of the cruelty charge instead, Condit could face an additional one year in jail, another $5,000 in fines after penalties, mandatory probation of at least four years and a mandatory criminal protective order.</p>
<p>Jean said Oct. 20 that the town is reviewing the case with an independent investigator to determine whether any department policies were violated.</p>
<p>“Pending the results of both the criminal investigation and administrative review, (we) will take appropriate action that reflects the values of the department,” she said.</p>
<p>Jean did not respond to requests for comment after the charges were filed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Everyday Encounters: An aspiring actor encourages others to follow their dreams</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/everyday-encounters-an-aspiring-actor-encourages-others-to-follow-their-dreams</link>
     <description>The 31-year-old Tiburon resident from Tijuana, Mexico, is recently secured her first paid gig in Los Angeles.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karen Gomez says she’s wanted to be an actor since she was a kid.</p>
<p>Now, the 31-year-old Tiburon resident from Tijuana, Mexico, is making progress toward that goal. She recently secured her first paid gig in Los Angeles — something both exciting and macabre: Gomez played a zombie for an ad that will appear on TikTok.</p>
<p>“It makes me feel like this dream was always possible, and that you, me and all of us have the ability to do it,” Gomez says in an interview conducted in Spanish as she sat on the banks near the Railroad Marsh Nov. 4. “It’s a matter of focus or, rather, truly following your dreams. I believe when you’ve got clarity on what you want, you’ll accomplish it.”</p>
<p>Gomez says she’s always loved to write and sing. Her mother shares those creative impulses, she says, taking pictures, reading and writing. Gomez remembers watching her mom do dubbing work as part of her university studies, an experience that wowed the young girl.</p>
<p>“I feel I got that from her,” Gomez says of her mom’s artistic interests.</p>]]></content:encoded>
