     <title>Tiburon resident looks to assess well-being with ‘vitality index’</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-resident-looks-to-assess-well-being-with-vitality-index</link>
     <description>Factors can be anything from how a person perceives their relationships with others and how healthy they feel to their environmental stewardship or creative pursuits.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Tiburon resident Jim Lavelle thinks about living well, he remembers his grandmother Mary.</p>
<p>She built a home in Belvedere in 1951 and lived to be 99 years old. As health-conscious eater and keen fitness practitioner, she worked out to videos made by fitness pioneer Jack LaLanne and swam at her local YWCA well into her 80s.</p>
<p>She inspired Lavelle, now 74, to pursue health — something he says has become easier with advances in modern science.</p>
<p>“But, on the other hand, there’s a difference between living a long time and living your best life for as long as you can — because you can be healthy and still be miserable,” the Tiburon resident says.</p>
<p>That distinction led Lavelle to create the Vitality Index and Rating, a 100-point scale on which people can determine their vitality score by identifying the 10 most important traits or factors in their life and scoring each from one to 10. Those scores are added up for an overall rating.</p>
<p>Factors can be anything from how a person perceives their relationships with others and how healthy they feel to their environmental stewardship or creative pursuits, Lavelle says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sebastian Rivas has built a successful career in real-estate investing, but he says he’s ready for a change.</p>
<p>“I want to be a cop,” says Rivas, a Tiburon resident who was walking his dogs, Rodeo and Farallon, at Shoreline Park Oct. 29.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old called the potential career change “kind of wild,” but noted he’s already taken the first steps by passing a written exam with the San Francisco Police Department. Next comes a physical test, an extensive background check and basic police academy, followed hopefully by a police job in San Francisco.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Richard Charles Otter</title>

     <description>Richard Charles Otter: September 13, 1933 – October 25, 2025.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Richard Charles Otter (September 13, 1933 – October 25, 2025) passed away peacefully, surrounded by family, in his home in Hillsborough, California. Throughout his incredible 92 years, Dick was remarkable in his ability to forge new connections and lifelong friendships. Whether aboard the Tiburon Ferry exchanging stories with neighbors, sharing laughs around a domino table, meeting prospective clients in his office, or offering thoughtful counsel at a board meeting, Dick’s warm smile and sparkling personality created genuine bonds with effortless ease, well into his ninth decade.</p>
<p>He was a seventh generation San Franciscan; tracing his ancestry to the late 18th century when his Spanish forebears came to California from Mexico. As his father was the manager of the Yosemite Lodge for decades, his childhood was split between Berkeley and the iconic Yosemite Valley. Spending his summers each year in the valley, Dick developed lifelong bonds to every aspect of that amazing place. Those links led to his eventually serving as chairman of the Yosemite Fund (now Yosemite Conservancy). He also served as the chair of the Save the Redwood League and on the board for more than 30 years — over which time he reviewed more than 200 acquisitions and 73,000 acres of California redwood forest. His connection to Yosemite also led to his serving as a founding member of the new University of California, Merced Foundation, the newest in the UC system, founded in 2005.</p>
<p>Dick was a proud Cal Bear, enrolling in UC Berkeley after graduating from Berkeley High. He was a member of Theta Chi fraternity. After college, Dick served in the United States Marine Corps, flying helicopters in Asia between the Korean and Vietnam wars.</p>
<p>Professionally, Dick would proudly describe himself as “just a stockbroker.” However, his modest description did not fully capture the role he played in creating and protecting wealth for his legions of loyal clients. He joined the famed San Francisco investment firm Davis, Skaggs & Co. in 1960 and retired 65 years later after that firm eventually transformed itself into Morgan Stanley. He famously never changed jobs — just the company name on the business card was frequently updated. Dick’s understanding of world markets was the product of lifelong curiosity and careful study of financial, economic, and political trends. He also shared his knowledge as an instructor of investments and economics at the College of Marin.</p>

     <title>Travel Bug: Exploring the high country offers fresh approach to Yosemite</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/travel-bug-exploring-the-high-country-offers-fresh-approach-to-yosemite</link>
     <description>Over the past three years, I have been questioning whether Yosemite was worth the frustration.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, our family visited Yosemite regularly, camping under canvas, staying in tent cabins and hiking between the High Sierra Camps. During off-peak months, we booked rooms at the Yosemite Valley Lodge. We once splurged on the Ahwahnee Hotel but found the experience underwhelming. Today, standard rooms at the Ahwahnee command $515 to $1,259 per night depending on seasonal demand, and reservations must be secured months in advance. Over the past three years, I’ve endured last-minute cancellations and struggled to secure any reservations at all. I began questioning whether Yosemite was worth the frustration.</p>
<p>Back in early August, before the federal shutdown, I decided to research alternative approaches to experiencing Yosemite’s high country — hopefully with fewer crowds and complications. I discovered three lodges near the Big Oak Flat entrance: Evergreen Lodge, Rush Creek Lodge and Blackberry Inn. We secured several mid-week nights at Evergreen Lodge without difficulty, drawn by its reputation for secluded, natural accommodations.</p>
<p>At Evergreen Lodge, I immediately began exploring the property, photographing the individual cabins, swimming pool, spa facilities and extensive recreational amenities. The 22-acre grounds house both traditional cabins and 22 luxury tents, scattered throughout the forested landscape to create an authentic wilderness experience. The lodge has become a sought-after wedding destination — staff informed us that every weekend through fall was completely booked with ceremonies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <media:description>I got to relax in a hammock at Evergreen Lodge, located near Yosemite’s Big Oak Flat entrance, which features traditional cabins and luxury tents, a pool, hot tub, play areas and bocce courts. The property provides a base for visitors exploring Olmsted Point — with its views of Half Dome — and less-crowded high-country destinations like May Lake and Tenaya Lake.

     <title>Neighbors threaten lawsuit over Strawberry senior-care project</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/neighbors-threaten-lawsuit-over-strawberry-senior-care-project</link>
     <description>The five-story, 150,655-square-foot building would house 106 units on a vacant lot at 70 N. Knoll Road, standing more than 60 feet tall.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fight is brewing over a senior-care facility planned for a Strawberry hillside, with neighbors threatening legal action and calling the project “absolutely, unequivocally insane.”</p>
<p>The five-story, 150,655-square-foot building would house 106 units on a vacant lot at 70 N. Knoll Road, standing more than 60 feet tall near homes in what residents describe as a semi-rural neighborhood. Marin County is moving forward with review and potential approval of the plan through a streamlining process that limits public input.</p>
<p>One local group led by Strawberry resident Scott Arwin said it is considering a lawsuit to block the facility. The group held a meeting at an Eagle Rock Road home Oct. 29 to organize opposition. Members cite safety risks for seniors, increased traffic, environmental concerns and the project’s poor fit with the area’s character, as well as noise, light and air-quality issues.</p>
<p>The developers — brothers Ali Shabahangi and Amir Kia of San Anselmo-based Spirit Living Group — submitted their latest application revision Oct. 6. The proposal includes 71 independent-living apartments and 35 assisted-living and memory-care suites on 3.7 acres of the 6.6-acre site, with the remaining acreage preserved as open space. The county is reviewing it and has until tomorrow, Nov. 6, to deem it complete or incomplete under the ministerial-review process.</p>
<p>“I just think it’s unfortunate that some neighbors are considering legal action against the project,” Shabahangi said in an interview. “It’s a project that I think addresses the lack of housing, particularly senior housing in the area. And we also understand that the state has established safeguards to prevent misuse of litigation to block housing. But our hope is that it doesn’t come to that.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere commission backs zoning changes for new housing</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-commission-backs-zoning-changes-for-new-housing</link>
     <description>The Planning Commission unanimously recommended zoning changes that would accommodate at least 160 new housing units</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By KEVIN HESSEL and TYLER CALLISTER</p>
<p>After nearly three years out of compliance with state housing requirements, Belvedere moved a step closer Oct. 21 when the Planning Commission unanimously recommended zoning changes that would accommodate at least 160 new housing units.</p>
<p>Both the revised housing element and related zoning amendments will go to the Belvedere City Council at its Nov. 10 meeting.</p>
<p>The move codifies changes the city made to its state-mandated housing element, which received tentative approval from the California Department of Housing and Community Development in July after three failed attempts.</p>
<p>Belvedere cannot be deemed compliant until all necessary rezoning matches the housing element. After City Council approval, the city will submit final versions to the state housing agency for certification.</p>
<p>The changes cover affordable-housing requirements and incentives, streamlined approval for developments with at least 20% affordable housing, design and development standards, mixed-use housing, emergency shelters, parking and reasonable-accommodation requests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Documentary traces mountain lion&apos;s trek through Tiburon and beyond</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/documentary-traces-mountain-lion-s-trek-through-tiburon-and-beyond</link>
     <description>The film is streaming online through Oct. 30 as part of the 2025 Green Film Festival of San Francisco.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fairfax resident Amelie Bluestone had long been fascinated by mountain lions when she learned about P36, the juvenile male that visited the Tiburon Peninsula in 2023 during a 1,400-mile trek across the Bay Area.</p>
<p>“P36 is a great example of what mountain lions go through on a day-to-day basis, but he did travel a remarkable distance,” she says. “And that’s what made him stand out to me and what made his story so interesting.”</p>
<p>Bluestone directed “The Path of Puma-36,” a documentary short film that follows P36’s 17-month journey across Northern California while wearing a tracking collar as part of the Living with Lions project at Stinson Beach-based conservation nonprofit All Hands Ecology, founded as Audubon Canyon Ranch by late Belvedere conservationist Marty Griffin in 1962.</p>
<p>Bluestone’s film is streaming online through Oct. 30 as part of the 2025 Green Film Festival of San Francisco following a showing at San Francisco’s 4 Star Theater Oct. 25. She plans another screening in Fairfax in December, though details are still being worked out, and she also plans to make the documentary available online after she finishes the film-festival circuit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Patricia Lakner, who lives on Mar East Street, said she regularly hears bullhorns from fishing-charter boats. She said at least four other neighbors also have complained.</p>
<p>“There are noise ordinances in effect practically everywhere that limit time and volume, and the bay should not be exempt,” she said by email. “Our complaint is not that there are fishing boats, but that they are unnecessarily loud, especially in the wee hours of the morning.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <description>The Tiburon father and son competed in the Directors’ Challenge Parent/Child Doubles race during the 2025 Head of the Charles Regatta.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Brian and Felix Davis, rowing is a family affair.</p>
<p>The Tiburon father and son competed in the Directors’ Challenge Parent/Child Doubles race during the 2025 Head of the Charles Regatta Oct. 19, the final day of the three-day annual regatta on the Charles River in Boston. The regatta is considered the largest in the sport by participants.</p>
<p>Both Davises row in eight-person sweeps in their respective age groups at the Greenbrae-based Marin Rowing Association, where they train six days a week. In sweeps, each rower uses a single oar while a ninth person serves as coxswain. Like father, like son: both row port side.</p>
<p>The parent-child race offered a unique opportunity for Brian and Felix to try sculling, where rowers propel the boat with two oars and no coxswain.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of helpful for the regular rowing stroke in our other boats because it helps with a balance aspect and putting everything together,” says Felix, a junior at Redwood High School. “And I think it actually helps apply to our other boats also, which is really great.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“I’m just kind of his driver,” Yang, 23, says of his role for Danser’s visit.</p>
<p>Danser, 22, meanwhile, has been acting as the official photographer for their trips, with Yang noting his friend’s particular fascination with plaques at sites and landmarks.</p>
<p>“He was scrolling through his camera, and he has like hundreds of them,” Yang says of Danser’s photos of plaques. “And I’m sure he’s never looked at them again.”</p>
<p>Danser is quick to challenge his friend’s assertion.</p>
<p>“I always look back at my plaques,” he says, adding that his favorite he captured so far was from their recent visit to Muir Woods National Monument.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon Town Hall exhibits feature multimedia collages, oil paintings</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-town-hall-exhibits-feature-multimedia-collages-oil-paintings</link>
     <description>Tiburon Heritage and Arts Commissioner Jaleh Etemad and Larkspur resident Debra Maddox are each exhibiting their works at Town Hall starting in November.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>‘Unseen’ is part of former Tiburon artist laureate Jaleh Etemad’s new Town Hall exhibit, opening Nov. 3, while 'Blue Polka Dot Dress’ is among the works on display at Debra Maddox’s Town Hall exhibit, ‘Evocations.’</p>
<p>Tiburon Heritage and Arts Commissioner Jaleh Etemad and Larkspur resident Debra Maddox are each exhibiting their works at Town Hall starting in November.</p>
<p>Etemad will show her multimedia collage works in a new exhibit opening Nov. 3 in the downstairs lobby. The exhibit coincides with the debut of her book, “Art of Life: Works by Jaleh Azar Etemad,” which includes nearly 300 of her pieces.</p>
<p>Etemad’s exhibit runs through Dec. 1 and features 35 paintings. An artist’s reception is set for 6-8 p.m. Nov. 7 at Town Hall and will include a conversation between Etemad and theater director, producer and educator Ginny Reed. Etemad will also sign copies of the book, which documents her evolution as an artist with numerous photos of her works. Each chapter describes moments that inspired her and the wide array of genres she has explored, including layered collage, painting, photography, altered books and three-dimensional works.</p>
<p>“As we live our lives, we evolve as human beings based on our various experiences,” she says. “I have done the same through my art.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Maddox’s exhibit, “Evocations,” will run Nov. 1-Dec. 31 in the upstairs Community Room and features two series of works in oil on canvas or oil on birch. An artist’s reception is set for 6-8 p.m. Nov. 11.</p>
<p>“I watch how light, shadow, color and texture transform shapes, and forms into compelling compositions,” she says. “This drives my desire to interpret what I see in the world around me. My work reflects two components — one is visual and the other is emotional.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Prescribed burn on Angel Island to begin as early as Oct. 31</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/prescribed-burn-on-angel-island-to-begin-as-early-as-oct-31</link>
     <description>The actual start date will depend on weather conditions, with the target Nov. 2.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Up to 100 acres of Angel Island State Park will undergo a prescribed burn beginning as early as Oct. 31.</p>
<p>California State Parks is leading the burn operation. Officials said in an Oct. 28 news release that residents should not call 911 to report smoke on the island.</p>
<p>State parks interpreter Ryan Forbes said in an email that while the prescribed burns may start as early as Halloween, the actual start date will depend on weather conditions. He said the burn will likely take place Nov. 2.</p>
<p>Smoke will likely be visible from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on burn days and may be visible for up to three days.</p>
<p>The operation aims to reduce fuel loads — combustible materials — in grasslands and coast-scrub areas on Angel Island.</p>
<p>The state park will remain open during burn days, and Angel Island-Tiburon Ferry service will not be affected, but trails and roads near the burn area will be closed for one to three days during and after the burn. Affected routes include segments of the Ida and Sunset trails and Park Fire Road. Access to Mount Livermore’s peak may also be limited on burn days.</p>
<p>Parks officials urged extreme caution for Angel Island visitors near the fire burns and asked them to follow posted signage and directions from parks staff or fire officials.</p>
<p>The burn is part of the parks agency’s Prescribed Fire Training Exchange, which gives firefighters and other fire personnel the opportunity to hone skills.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Reed district warned to rein in deficit spending</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-district-warned-to-rein-in-deficit-spending</link>
     <description>Unless the district cuts $1.75 million over two years, its reserves will fall short of the required 27% minimum by fiscal year 2027-2028.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Marin County Office of Education has warned the Reed Union School District about its “unsustainable” deficit spending, noting that unless the district cuts about $1.75 million from its budget in the next two years, it will fall short of its reserve goals by fiscal 2027-2028.</p>
<p>The warning was issued in a Sept. 15 letter approving the district’s current-year $33.2-million budget and its accompanying projections two years out; the county Office of Education is required to review the budget annually under the state education code to ensure it meets state standards for fiscal solvency and aligns with the district’s Local Control Accountability Plan.</p>
<p>Though the county has vouched for the district’s ability to meet its financial obligations in the next three years, the letter notes the district’s planned deficit spending will shrink its ending fund balance by 35% in that time as it pulls from its reserves to close the gap. That projection, it notes, is inclusive of a planned $300,000 in salary reductions beginning in the 2026-2027 school year.</p>
<p>If the district continues to deficit spend at the projected rates, the county letter says, its unrestricted general fund balance will fall to about 21.5% of expenditures, or about $7.6 million, by fiscal year 2027-2028 — short of the district policy that requires a minimum reserve of 27% of expenditures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Reed district test scores show gains in English, math</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/reed-district-test-scores-show-gains-in-english-math</link>
     <description>Some 81% of Reed students met English standards and 79% met math standards, significantly outpacing Marin County and statewide averages.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Standardized test scores in the Reed Union School District rose about five percentage points in English and four points in math, with local students once again outperforming their peers across the county and state by significant margins.</p>
<p>Some 81% of Reed district students met or exceeded grade-level standards in English, 79% in math, according to results of the 2024-2025 exam released Oct. 9 by the California Department of Education. That’s up from the 76% of students who met or exceeded English standards and the 75% who met or exceeded math standards on last year’s exam.</p>
<p>The district’s scores remain markedly higher than the average in Marin, where about 62% of students met or exceeded standards in English and 54% in math. Statewide, just 49% of students met or exceeded standards in English, 37% in math.</p>
<p>Reed district Coordinator of Educational Services Nicole Trickett called the increases in both math and language arts “pretty significant,” noting that even when the district does see increases to scores, it doesn’t always see such a large bump.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Strawberry senior facility raises concerns over size, fit</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/strawberry-senior-facility-raises-concerns-over-size-fit</link>
     <description>The 106-unit facility would include 71 independent-living apartments and 35 assisted-living suites on the 6.6-acre hillside site off North Knoll Road.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A five-story, 150,655-square-foot senior-care facility proposed for a vacant Strawberry hillside off North Knoll Road is advancing through Marin County’s approval process despite vocal opposition from neighbors who say the development doesn’t fit their semi-rural neighborhood.</p>
<p>The developers, brothers Ali Shabahangi and Amir Kia of San Anselmo-based Spirit Living Group, submitted the latest revision to their application Oct. 6, proposing 106 total units, with 71 independent-living apartments and 35 assisted-living and memory-care suites. The building would occupy 3.7 acres of the 6.6-acre site at 70 N. Knoll Road, with the remaining acreage to be preserved as open space.</p>
<p>The county now has until Nov. 6 to deem the application complete or incomplete under the ministerial-review process, or streamlined approval in which local governments must approve projects that meet objective standards without discretionary hearings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon officer placed on leave after DUI, child-endangerment arrest in Petaluma</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-officer-placed-on-leave-after-dui-child-endangerment-arrest-in-petaluma</link>
     <description>An independent investigator will review whether any departmental policies were violated as the district attorney weighs potential charges.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tiburon police officer has been placed on administrative leave after he was arrested Oct. 13 near downtown Petaluma on suspicion of driving under the influence and child endangerment.</p>
<p>The officer, employed by the Tiburon Police Department since June 2019, was off duty when arrested about 4 p.m. and then booked into Sonoma County Jail in Santa Rosa on allegations of child abuse with possible great bodily injury or death — a “wobbler” case that could result in a misdemeanor or felony charge punishable by up to six years in prison and a $10,000 fine if convicted — plus two misdemeanor allegations of drunken driving.</p>
<p>One is for suspicion of impaired driving at any level of intoxication and the other for exceeding a blood-alcohol content of at least 0.08%, California’s legal limit for drivers 21 and older. Drivers convicted of a first-time DUI face an average of $13,500 in fines and penalties as well as a suspended license, according to Tiburon police.</p>
<p>The Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office confirmed it is reviewing the case for the potential charges.</p>
<p>“The Tiburon Police Department will fully cooperate with the ongoing investigation led by the Sonoma County (District Attorney’s) Office,” Chief Michelle Jean said in an Oct. 20 press statement. “In addition, the town is reviewing the circumstances of the arrest and has engaged with an independent investigator to ensure a fair and impartial review of whether any Police Department policies were violated. The Police Department holds its officers to the highest standards of conduct and, pending the results of both the criminal investigation and administrative review, will take appropriate action that reflects the values of the department.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Belvedere council reduces Blanding Lane construction fine to $210,000</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/belvedere-council-reduces-blanding-lane-construction-fine-to-210-000</link>
     <description>The penalty was reduced by $120,000 after the council granted relief for fire training use and water district delays but rejected other claims.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Blanding Lane homeowner will pay a $210,000 penalty for construction delays after the Belvedere City Council granted only partial relief from his original $330,000 fine.</p>
<p>Owner Chris Henry had appealed for a complete waiver of the penalty. At the Oct. 13 City Council meeting, officials agreed to reduce the fine by $120,000 after a two-hour hearing but denied most of his arguments for leniency.</p>
<p>The city’s construction time-limit ordinance allows 18 months to finish a project costing over $500,000, with an optional six-month extension. Henry’s deadline expired April 21, 2024. Penalties accrued daily at $1,200 through the project’s completion April 8, 2025 — 320 days late.</p>
<p>The council voted unanimously to grant 100 days of relief. The reduction covered 10 days Henry allowed Tiburon Fire Protection District to use the property for training exercises and 90 days for delays caused by a Marin Municipal Water District infrastructure leak.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <title>Tiburon council OKs commission’s picks for early design of ponds site, mini parks</title>
     <link>https://www.thearknewspaper.com/live/tiburon-council-oks-commission-s-picks-for-early-design-of-ponds-site-mini-parks</link>
     <description>Two design firms will create conceptual plans for a basketball court, new swings and improvements at the former sanitation ponds site by spring 2026.</description>
     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiburon will spend $94,600 to create early design concepts for improvements at the former sanitation ponds site and three neighborhood mini parks, including a basketball court and new swings.</p>
<p>The Town Council voted unanimously Oct. 15 to approve contracts with two firms for 30% conceptual designs. Mill Valley-based RHAA Landscape Architecture and Planning will design improvements at Belveron Mini Park and the former ponds site near McKegney Green for $49,728. Santa Rosa-based Carlile Macy Inc. will design improvements at Cypress Hollow Park and the Bel Aire play area for $44,870.</p>
<p>The agreements allow the council to review conceptual plans before deciding whether to proceed with full construction documents, Public Works Engineering Manager David Eshoo wrote in a staff report. Funding comes from the town’s fiscal year 2025-2026 capital improvement program.</p>]]></content:encoded>
